# The Space Marine Legions

## Code Institute Portfolio Project 1: User-centric Front-end Development using HTML and CSS

### Background

I am a huge fan of the Warhammer 40,000 science-fiction setting. Warhammer 40k, as it is commonly known, is primarily a physical table-top game played with dice, painted miniatures and tape measures. It has existed in one form or another for about 40 years, and over that time, it has grown in many ways - playable armies, the range of miniatures, paints, and so on

Another way in which it has grown is the background information, referred to as the lore or, more affectionately, the 'fluff' (as opposed to the 'crunch' of the physical game rules)

Much of the story-telling revolves around the primary human civilisation of the setting, the Imperium of Mankind, a hyper-militant fascistic theocracy spanning a million worlds. In Imperium itself has existed for 10,000 years. It was founded in the 31st Millenium, called M31 in the parlance of the setting, and the current setting takes place in the 41st Millenium, or M41. 

A long-running series of books, the Horus Heresy series, was started by Games Workshop's publishing house, Black Library, about 15 years ago, to explore the founding of the Imperium. The short version is this - the Imperium was founded by the Emperor of Mankind, who used genetically-enhanced warriors called Space Marines to conquer the Milky Way galaxy. The Space Marines were organised into 18 Legions, each Legion having diverging doctrinally, organisationally and genetically. Each was led by a general - a genetically engineered being called a Primarch, who provided the genetic enhancements that created the Space Marines. 

As the Great Crusade, as this campaign of galatic conquest was known, drew to a close, the Emperor's most accomplished Primarch - Horus Lupercal of the 16th Legion - betrayed the Imperium and the Emperor. He took fully half of the Space Marine Legions - his own 'Sons of Horus' and 8 others - into rebellion, and waged a campaign to topple the Emperor. Thus began the Horus Heresy. The other 9 Loyalist Legions opposed Horus, and wars of untold ferocity raged across human space. After years of hard fighting, Horus and his Traitor Legions arrived at Earth, the seat of the Emperor. 

The Siege of Terra, as the final battle was called, was titanic in scale. Casualties of both sides were immense. At the climax of the battle, when all seemed lost, the Emperor himself took the field, launching a teleport strike on Horus' flagship, his aim a decapitation stike both metaphorical and literal. The Emperor and Horus battled hand-to-hand. Horus, a consumate warrior-king, inflicted grevious injuries on the Emperor, but the Emperor proved victorius. With Horus' death, and Loyalist reinforcements imminent, the Traitor Legions broke and ran. 

The Space Marine Legions are interesting organisations. Each is very different. Their homeworlds and genetics give rise to wildly varying cultures and combat doctrines. Some are savage berserkers, revelling in hand-to-hand combat. Others are more professional, excelling in modern combined-arms warfare. Others are stranger still. All have a unique character. I personally am fascinated by the detailed backgrounds, organisations, doctrines and histories. 

### Scope

This website is intended to provide users with with a distillation of my knowledge of the Space Marine Legions. 

Other sites exist to do this - namely [the Warhammer 40k fandom wiki](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Warhammer_40k_Wiki) and [Lexicanum](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Main_Page)

That said, I personally dislike using these sites. The Lexicanum site has a boring and uninteresting colour palette of grey and black. The Fandom site is more interesting, especially with the striking background image. However, I find it suffers from bloat - the information is not condensed as you might expect from a wikia site, and is often copy-pasted directly from source material. Neither makes for an especially enjoyable reading experience - with Lexicanum, the user is forced to endure the bland colours, and with the Fandom site, the user to forced to trawl through a seemingly endless screed of often-contradictory information. 

This website aims to fix that. It will make good use of the fantastically detailed artwork and will use an appealing, setting-appropriate colour palette. The content presented will be my own distillation of the source material. As I am the sole author, I can ensure that all of the information presented is correct and accurate as best as I can determine, but that it does not go into unnecessary and trivial detail. It will also be focused entirely on the Space Marine Legions, though scope exists for additional pages to be added dealing with other aspects of the Horus Heresy setting, such as in-setting history, other factions and major battles. 

The site is planned to consist of 4 pages - an index landing page, a contact page, and two content pages, one for the Loyalist Legions and the other for the Traitor Legions.

The index page consists of a background image, an eye-catching heading, a small navigation pane on the upper-right hand side, a block of text discussing the purpose of the site and two buttons that are links to the two content pages. 

The content pages are the main feature of the site. Each features 9 articles, one for each of the Legions, since there were 9 Loyalist and 9 Traitor Legions.

The contact page is intended as a contact form, a way for users to get in touch with me to discuss any aspect of the Warhammer 40k setting, from books to rulesets. A properly working contact form is currently beyond my skills and beyond the scope of the project, though my Mentor has indicated that it is relatively simple to turn it into a working form. This should provide an excellent addition to the project. 

### Audience

The intended audience of this site are people who are already fans of the Warhammer 40k setting and who already have some knowledge of the setting's background information, but who have little knowledge of the finer details of the Space Marine Legions. This is deliberate - the setting is so complex that introducing a new person and getting them up to speed is considered a difficult task among existing fans. Adding sufficient content to the site to introduce a new person would make the site unwieldy and overlong, and that would be before any of the intended content could be added. The idea is for this site to be passed around existing fans in order to pass on knowledge that makes the setting even richer and more detailed. A page for the introduction of new people to the setting could be considered a future addition to the site. 

### Function

The index.html page is intended as the landing page. 

The traitors.html page is the page discussing Horus' Traitor Legions, the Nine Who Turned

The loyalists.html page is the page discussing the Imperium's Loyalist Legions, The Nine Who Stood

The contact.html page contains a contact form. As a working contact form is outside of the scope of the project and beyond my skills, it will merely submit the entered information to https://formdump.codeinstitute.net


### Wireframes

I had the idea for this project some weeks into starting the Code Institute course and began refining it mentally soon after. The project was properly started on the 24th of January 2022 with some basic wireframes drawn on a few sheets of A3 paper. These were refined into digital wireframes using Balsamiq, which were updated following a Mentor planning session with Ronan McLelland. These are the initial design of the project, and any differences are the result of experimentation and iteration. These are stored in the repository in the assets/wireframes directory. The images are below. 

Homepage:<br>

Content pages

Contact.png - the wireframe for contact.html, the contact form:<br>
![Contact](assets/wireframes/contact.png)

A conscious effort was made to ensure that the same basic design applies to all pages - a bright, colourful (possibly violent) background image, a heading on a dark background, a small nav bar to the upper right of the window, a fixed footer and all content in dark coloured boxes.



### Technologies

Github was used to host the project repository

Gitpod was used to create and edit the project files. The Preview Browser proved useful in seeing the results of minor changes

Github Pages was used to deploy the site and allow it to be accessed by the general public

Balsamiq was used to create the initial digital wireframes

Slack was used to hold video calls with my Mentor, Ronan McLelland, and discuss the direction of the project and its features

Google Docs was used to create the information file from which the site content was drawn

Lighthouse was used for testing



### Future work

Since this project will only use HTML and CSS, a working contact form that actually allows a user to send me a message and begin a discussion is outside of the scope, since this requires web-development skills that I have not yet learnt.

Per the wireframes for the content pages, buttons that scroll the images in the image galleries back and forth were originally envisioned. However, research into this showed that this was only possible using JavaScript, such as [in this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82f07Xf0xgE). Once I have learned JavaScript, buttons may be added. 



## Usage

This repository can be cloned and edited in Gitpod out of the box - there are no external libraries or dependencies required. A preview browser can be opend by running the server. To do this, type in the terminal:

`python3 -m http.server` and hit enter

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

## Bugs

A small bug was noted early in development - When navigating to the traitor.html and loyalist.html pages, ocassionally the scroll-bar on the right-hand-side of the screen does not load, though scrolling is still possible via mouse-wheel. Since the scroll-bar takes up viewport width, the positioning and dimensions of the content of the pages is adjusted. The lack of the scroll-bar and subsequent adjustment is especially apparent when navigating from traitor.html to loyalist.html and vice-versa, as they have essentially the same layout - the elements appear to jerk to the right. This is jarring. As of 3/2/2022, the cause of this is unknown, possibly related to internet connection speeds and browser load times.  


## Credits

### Inspiration

[The Warhammer 40k fandom wiki](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Warhammer_40k_Wiki) and [Lexicanum](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Main_Page) provided the idea of a wikia-type website for the Space Marine Legions. The Fandom site with its colourful background and dark box containing the content overlaying it was a definite inspiration

### Images

The Warhammer 40k setting has created hundreds of images over the years, and proper acknowledgements are difficult to make. Most of the images were taken from the Space Marine Legion pages on [the Warhammer 40k fandom wiki](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Warhammer_40k_Wiki):
