                <h4>History</h4>

                <p>  
                    The Emperor's Children, being the 3rd Legion, were one of the first Legions founded by the Emperor. In their first years as an active military force, 
                    they recruited heavily from the noble families and aristocracies of the Europa region of Terra, after that area had been pacified by the Thunder Warriors. 
                    <hr>
                    The early 3rd Legion was not numerically strong, and so they often found themselves operating in concert with the Emperor's human armies, those regiments
                    and divisions that would go on to form the Imperial Army. Either because of the intelligence granted to them from their gene-seed, or perhaps 
                    because of their aristocractic orgins and the long traditions of military leadership associated with the nobility, the 3rd Legion excelled at this task. 
                    The Antarctic Clearance, the taking of Nadarin by the Bronze Host and the 5th Raising of Jove-Sat II are all the handiwork of the Legion.
                    <hr>
                    The 3rd Legion also found work as diplomatic bodyguards, dangerous tasks that the Legion were proud to carry out. As the Great Crusade progressed, the 
                    Legion reprised its role as leaders and planners by taking command of Imperial Army formations raised from newly-Compliant worlds. They carried standards
                    bearing the Emperor's Palatine Eagle into battle, preventing many of these Imperial Army units from running away. The Legion's iconic colour scheme of 
                    Imperial Purple comes from this role.
                    <hr>
                    One of the more famous incidences involving the 3rd Legion was the Proximan Betrayal. Early on in the Great Crusade, the Proximans had surrendered, and
                    the Emperor himself attended the Compliance ceremonies. The Proximans had planned a betrayal however, and deployed a devastating Vortex weapon to 
                    injure the Emperor. The 3rd Legion's 16th Cohort fought to the last man to evacuate the Emperor. In recognition, the Emperor granted the Legion the right
                    to decorate the chestplates of their armour with the Palatine Aquila, an eagle-shaped device. The Emperor's own standard was also granted to the Legion as
                    a relic. 
                    <hr>
                    Soon after the Proximan Betrayal, the 3rd Legion was plunged into crisis. A transport ship carrying some of the Legion's gene-seed reserve to Luna to set up 
                    a recruitment centre was destroyed, either by an attack or by accident. Whilst a blow, this was not necessarily fatal, as the gene-seed could be replaced
                    given time. Soon after, a viral attack swept through the gene-seed vaults of several Legions on Terra. Much of the precious gene-seed was lost, including all 
                    of the 3rd Legion's reserve. Now, with no way to replace fallen warriors, the 3rd Legion began to die. 
                    <hr>
                    The Legion was only saved thanks to the chance recovery of their Primarch, Fulgrim, from Chemos. Chemos had, like the Legion, been slowly dying. Fulgrim, by his
                    intellect and skill, had saved Chemos. Now, he could save his Legion. When father and sons met, the Legion numbered only 200 men. Fulgrim knelt before his Legion
                    saying <em>"You are the Emperor's chosen, his heralds, his warriors, his children, for this is only the beginning"</em>. On hearing this, the Emperor official renamed
                    the 3rd Legion the Emperor's Children. Fulgrim was able to provide pure gene samples, and with recruits from both Chemos and the nobility of other worlds, the 3rd Legion was able to begin to rebuild their 
                    depleted ranks. 
                    <hr>
                    However, the 3rd Legion was still tiny in comparison to other Legions, many of whom boasted enough men to handle multiple deployments at the same time. 
                    To get the Emperor's Children back into the Great Crusade, they joined the Luna Wolves of Horus Lupercal. The two Legions complemented each other, 
                    the Wolves' direct aggression balanced by the 3rd's speed and flexibility. Even when this association ended, the two Legions were bonded. 
                    <hr>
                    The Emperor's Children set out to master battle in all its forms. They studied other Legion's tactics and doctrines. In one case, when the Legion had 
                    collaborated with the Ultramarines to destroy the Orks on Mirga, Guilliman praised the Emperor's Children for demonstrating his own counter-attack 
                    doctrines better than the Ultramarines had. 
                    <hr>
                    However, this desire to master all aspects of war eventually led to both pride and resentment. When they excelled, they felt contempt for those unable to 
                    match them. When others were honoured for their own skills and achievements, the Emperor's Children became jealous. 
                    When both Legion and Primarch were enticed into betrayal is unclear, but whatever the cause and whenever it fell, 
                    it fell on ground made fertile by jealousy and pride.   
                    
                </p>

                <h4>Observations</h4>

                <p>
                    The Emperor's Children are a carefully organised and ordered military force. This comes from Fulgrim, who believes that excellent 
                    comes from considering even the smallest details. 
                    <hr>
                    The Legion has not deviated much from the organisational pattern laid down in the <em>Principia Bellicosa</em>, the 
                    manual of war for the Space Marine Legions. The Legion is broken down into 30 Millenials, the equivalent of Chapters of other Legions. 
                    <hr>
                    The hierarchy of the Emperor's Children is rigid. Each warrior is placed according to his strengths, and he is expected to excel in that area. 
                    Likewise, the Legion is not given to reorganising on the fly. Changes to organisation happen only after careful, patient consideration. 
                    <hr>
                    The Legion's squads show the most variance, and each has a particular purpose, and is given specialised training and equipment to fulfil that role. 
                    All of the various squad types extant in the Legions can be found in the Emperor's Children, which comes from their desire to master all forms of war. 
                    <hr>
                    Doctrinally, the Legion favours speed in all things - preferring the use of vehicles, bikers and jump troops on the tactical level. This comes from a
                    doctrinal belief that the warrior who strikes first will be victorius, and the Legion's battle honours lend this belief credence. The Legion favours this 
                    approach because their low numerical strength has never really allowed them to engage in attritional warfare, and Fulgrim desires a low casualty count 
                    to go with his victories. 
                    <hr>
                    On the strategic level, the Legion favours extensive planning, and its officers take into account every possible factor - logistics, the 
                    possibility of reinforcements, weather, the abilities of allied forces, and so on. This often makes for an effective approach to war, but it also renders them
                    inflexible - should unforeseen events happen, the Legion can be wrong-footed, suffering the consequences. 
                    <hr>
                    The Legion's command structure is as inflexible as its organisation. Directly below Fulgrim are the Princes of War, ten Lord Commanders who command the first 
                    10 Millenials of the Legion. The Princes of War lead Legion forces, Imperial Army regiments and other allied units on campaign. From the Lord Commanders, 
                    authority flows down to the Praetorate, the commanders who lead the rest of the Legion's various units. From authority flows down to the Centurions of the 
                    Legion's Companies, and from there to the Sergeants of the squads. 
                    <hr>
                    The Emperor's Children have a particular admiration, some might say obsession, for duelling, and many men of the Legion fight in duels. From this, the Legion's men 
                    are often particularly able swordsmen. The Charnabal Sabre is particularly favoured as a duelling sword, and the Legion in general has a habit of 
                    collecting trophy weapons from defeated foes. Many of the Legion's best Champions have extensive collections of swords taken from foes.

            <h4>History</h4>

            <p>
                The early 4th Legion's gene-seed was noted as being particularly stable and adaptable to a wide range of recruits, allowing it to both expand rapidly and 
                allow quick replacement of casualties. When Mars joined with the Imperium, war machines from the Martian forges flowed to the Legion as a reward for their
                victories. When the 3rd Legion's gene-seed reserves were destroyed, their recruits went to the 4th Legion. This rapid expansion in strength allowed the Legion
                to form several Expedition fleets. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As the Great Crusade progressed, and the Legion took and replaced casualties with recruits from other worlds, the Legion's ties to Terra quickly withered. 
                However, the Legion's organisation and doctrine remained unchanged. Their numbers and war machines allowed the Legion to meet its foes with overwhelming force. 
                They were tasked with fighting vital but inglorious campaigns, doing the drudge work of the Great Crusade. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Within 50 years, the Imperium came to Olympia, where Perturabo had crash landed. Olympia was a unique world with an interesting socio-political structure.
                Rather than having nations, the main political powers of Olympia were city-states. This was because Olympia was very mountainous - these mountains prevented the 
                city-states from developing large scale agriculture and hence population bases, and also prevented them from unifying into nations. As a result of endless wars over 
                resources, the Olympians became adept fortification engineers. Sieges hence became the primary mode of warfare.
            </p>

            <p>
                After crash landing, Perturabo spent some time as a wandering artisan and mercenary, before coming to the city-state of Lochos, ruled by the tyrant Dammekos. 
                Perturabo, his skills and ability evident, was offered a place in Dammekos' court, where he took command of Lochos' forces and developed new war machines to aid them. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When Perturabo was recovered, he was given command of the 4th Legion. At the time, the Legion numbered some 50,000 men, a low number given their ability to replace 
                casualties. The Legion had been taking many casualties in their campaigns, and in their most recent campaign to take Forge World Incaladion, they had lost 29,000 men, 
                a staggering number even during the Great Crusade. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Perturabo reviewed his Legion's performance and found them wanting. His punishment was suitably harsh - decimation. One in every 10 men was to be selected at random
                and then beaten to death by his brothers. Predictably, this went over poorly with the other Legions, who condenmed the waste of Space Marine lives. Guilliman
                in particular lamented the loss of several senior officers whom he had known and respected. Perturabo's reasoning was that the Legion had not achieved their full 
                potential, and that it had to stand superior to all others.
            </p>

            <h4>Observations</h4>

            <p>
                Perturabo calls his Legion the Iron Warriors, and since taking command has imposed his own stamp on the Legion. The Legion is broken down into Grand Battalions, 
                the equivalent of other Legion's Chapters. The Grand Battalions however function more like miniature Legions, each possessing considerable organic 
                armour reserves and logistical support. Each Grand Battalion includes units of the Tyranthikos, the Legion's Terminator elite. 
                Each Grand Battalion is then broken down into several Grand Companies, the equivalent of battalions. These are then split 
                into line companies, with vehicles organised into armour centuries.  
            </p>

            <p>
                The Legion is politically isolated, maintaining poor relations with other Legions, especially the Imperial Fists, with whom they share a penchant for fortification. 
                Rather than being a friendly competition, the Iron Warriors have made this a bitter rivalry. Perturabo and Rogal Dorn have considerable personal animosity. 
                The Iron Warrior's only real allies are the Mechanicum, as both value logic and technological ability. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Doctrinally, the Iron Warriors prefer siege warfare, and to aid in this keep the largest artillery division of all the Legions. They also possess 
                large reserves of tanks and other vehicles, particularly larger ones, such as Land Raiders, Fellblades and Mastodons. The Legion's excellent relations with
                the Mechanicum allow them to field larger than normal numbers of rarer vehicles such as Cerberus tank destroyers and Scorpius missile vehicles and 
                Thunderstrike artillery. Smaller, simpler vehicles such as Rhinos, Basilisks and Predators are available in huge numbers.  
            </p>

            <p>
                The Legion also fields large numbers of Destroyer units, and has little compunction about using them. These units are directed by the Stor-Bezashk, who
                are the Legion's siege masters and keepers of nuclear weapons and phosphex munitions. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Interestingly, the Legion contains a number of warrior societies, which function as symposiums to improve the Legion's combat craft and provide specialised knowlegde:

                <ul>

                    <li>The Dodecatheon is the Legion's fortification and strategic symposium. Historical battles are recreated in simulations, which are used by rival officers to 
                        settle differences
                    </li>

                    <li>The Apolokron is the Legion's symposium for the study of battle-automata, including the design, construction and use of such devices.
                        Despite good relations with the Mechanicum, the Apolokron has gone over poorly with the Legio Cybernetica, the traditional operators of 
                        battle-automata. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The Kheledakos is the Legion's symposium for space warfare, including studing the construction and employment of ships. The Magi of the Mechanicum 
                        attend the Kheledakos. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The Lyssatra is the Legion's symposium for the more unhinged members of the Legion, and they study the most terrible engines of destrution. 
                        The Lyssatra has a cult-like flavour to it, and rumour has it they dabble with xenos technology and occult ideology. 
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </p>

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>When they were first activated during the closing stage of the Unification Wars, the 8th Legion were deployed as a secret police. 
                    Those nations and cities on Terra that joined the nascent Imperium did not always do so willingly, and some of these failed to appreciate 
                    that the Emperor was bringing an end to the relentless wars of Terra. In these cases, the 8th Legion were deployed to quell the rebellion and enact retribution. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 8th Legion's Primarch, Konrad Curze, landed on Nostramo. Nostramo was a damned world - sunless and corrupt. Nostramo was part of a group 
                    of worlds that had retained the ability to travel the Warp during the Age of Strife. Nostramo was covered with cities and industry, and had wealth
                    in the form of valuable adamintine ore, which was mined and shipped to other worlds. Nostramo's industry and mining had poisoned the atmosphere, shortening the 
                    lives of its inhabitants. Murder was rife on Nostramo, and gangs ruled every square metre, from the highest towers of the nobility to the lowest slums. These 
                    gangs existed in a sort of feudal system, each owning fealty to a baron or count, who in turn served bosses who styled themselves monarchs and emperors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When Curze crash-landed, he was forced to survive alone - unlike other Primarchs, there was no surogate father for him. Rather than become an apex-killer, 
                    Curze decided to bring justice to Nostramo. At first, he hunted murderers and thugs, then entire gangs. Bodies were crucified on buildings as messages. 
                    A name of sorts began to follow Curze - the Night Haunter. When the barons and princes heard of this, they sent hunters after Curze. Most of these 
                    he killed, save a few he sent back to their masters with a simple message - <em>I am coming for you</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eventually, the whole of Nostramo had been quelled by Curze's fearsome displays. When Curze met the self-styled nobility of Nostramo, they surrendered to him, 
                    and he became ruler of the planet.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    After almost 100 years of the Great Crusade had passed, the Emperor came to Nostramo. Curze joined the Emperor, taking command of his Legion. 
                    The Legion's culture began to change. At first, these were minor changes - Nostraman became the language of the Legion, and as Nostramans were recruited, 
                    the customs and rites of the Nostraman gangs spread through the Legion. Officers began to adopt titles, much like the aristocrats of Nostramo. 
                    The Legion's purpose of bringing order from chaos did not change however, and the Nostraman recruits complemented the Terrans. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, once Curze left, the fragile peace he had imposed broke down. Nostramo continued to provide recruits, but these were gangsters already soaked in blood.
                    Thus, the Legion was slowly poisoned, with many Night Lords becoming simple murderers. Curze's leadership did not help matters, and many times Compliance actions
                    ended in populations being decimated for no apparent reason. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the last years of the Great Crusade, the Night Lords had become ever more distrusted by their brother Legions, always not far from being censured. 
                    The snap came when Curze confided in Fulgrim. Fulgrim broke this trust, informing Rogal Dorn. In the Cheraut system Curze fought and almost killed Dorn. 
                    Soon after, word that Nostramo had finally slipped back into lawlessness reached Curze. Near mad, Curze took his Legion to Nostramo and shattered it with 
                    an orbital bombardment.  
                </p>


    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>The Night Lords favour terror tactics, and often make use of these to undermine enemy morale and cohesion. This makes them particularly effective
                    when fighting human forces. This penchant for bloody violence is not just directed at their enemies however. Rivalry, often fatal, is endemic within the Legion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Night Lords are nonetheless a Space Marine Legion, and fully capable of fighting as one. All of the various specialised squads are present in the 
                    Legion's ranks, though units configured for siege operations are rarer. The Night Lords employ two unique squad types - the Terror squads, and the Night Raptors.
                    Night Raptors are the Legion's variation on assault squads, whilst the Terror squads do just that - spread terror amongst their foes. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The basic strategic unit of the Night Lords is the Company, with a strength ranging from 100 to 1,000. Most Companies adopted a title to go with their 
                    numerical designation, such as the 27th Company, called <em>the Shattered Skull</em>, the 104th Company, called <em>the Sable Brothers</em>, and the 71st Company, 
                    called <em>the Crimson Judges</em>. The higher level organisational units like battalions and Chapters were used as semi-permanent groupings for task forces, rather 
                    than as permanent units. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's command body is called the Kyroptera, a group hand-picked by Curze for their ability. These are the Legion's ruling elite, and are responsible
                    for leading task forces and organising the Legion's deployments. The Legion's Terminator elite are called the Atramentar, who are commanded by 
                    First Captain Jago Sevatarion. The Atramentar are famously loyal to Curze, and they are often used as enforcers to keep the more fractious elements
                    of the Legion in line. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Night Lords do not maintain large numbers of vehicles, but they are capable of fielding the full range of Space Marine tanks and transports. 
                    Rather than being held in reserve, the Legion's armour is often allocated to Companies directly, and a rare few Companies are capable of deploying as purely
                    armoured formations. When deployed, these formations strike hard and fast, often at night, and often choose to break through enemy lines to cut off supplies 
                    and encircle them. 
                </p>

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>Unlike many Legions, the 12th Legion's recruits were not drawn from any particular region or population. That said, those recruits underwent 
                    psychological screening to select only the most aggressive and competitive. This meant that from the outset, the Legion developed a reputation
                    as a highly aggressive force. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's first action was the Sa'afrik Liberation, where they acted as shock troops. They mounted unsubtle, direct assaults on enemy positions, 
                    compensating for their low numbers with courage and sheer violence. After this, however, the Legion was held in reserve, and saw little action. On those 
                    rare ocassions, the Legion performed well. It was during the Unification Wars that the Legion earnt its first name, the War Hounds, for their 
                    tenacious savagery in clearing out the Cephic Hives. The Legion adopted a red hound as their icon. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    During the very first actions of the Great Crusade, the War Hounds saw their first major action - a mission only they could undertake. The asteroid prison colony
                    of Cerberus, home to some 3 million prisoners, had risen up in revolt. Initial pacification missions were unsuccessful, and revealed that the revolt had 
                    been instigated by a band of Thunder Warriors calling themselves the Dait'Tar. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Led by Praetor-Commander Calyb Hax, the War Hounds launched their attack at 3:00 in the morning. By 8:00 in the morning, Hax signalled victory, and 
                    also that he had taken no prisoners. The War Hounds had been thorough and brutal, attacking directly, though often at great cost. Whilst the human 
                    insurrectionists were easily overcome, the Dait'Tar often dragged 3 or 4 War Hounds down the grave with them, a mark of the Thunder Warriors' 
                    own combat power. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Colonel Alves Scorn, leading follow-up elements, observed 
                    <em>"I do not doubt my Emperor's wisdom in creating a necessary evil ssuch as these warriors, nor do I doubt their effectiveness in battle. It remains my
                    fervent hope however that though I spend my life making war for the liberation of Mankind that I never again see such inhuman butchery as I have witnessed in
                    the halls of Cerberus"</em>. 
                </p> 

                <p>
                    As the Great Crusade progressed, the War Hound found themselves broken up into several battle-groups, each boasting several thousand legionaries. The largest 
                    of these was the 13th Expedition, called the Bloody 13th. These battle groups acted as mobile reserves, directed to particularly fierce warzones. 
                    In these battles, the War Hounds acted with customary directness, conducting furious line-breaker attacks. Often, however, casualties were high, and 
                    it was not uncommon for War Hound forces to be slaughtered, though even in death they were often able to damage the enemy badly enough for allied forces to 
                    mop them up.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The War Hounds' inate aggression often had legionaries attacking either each other or allies who they deemed to have failed in battle. This necessitated 
                    their officers maintaining harsh discipline. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the other Legions grew in size and become more able to conduct operations without need of reinforcements, the War Hounds were increasingly tasked with 
                    annihilation missions. To facilitate this, the War Hounds disparate forces joined the 13th Expedition, and established a training base on Bodt. There, they 
                    were reinforced with other mistrusted Imperial forces, such as the Titans of the Legio Audax and the Numen Gun Clans. The Primarch Sanguinius is supposed to 
                    have had a moment of dry wit and said <em>"The Emperor is assembling a carnival for his amusement, although I doubt whoever he unleashes them upon will
                    see the jest"</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion was soon reunited with its Primarch, Angron, on Nuceria. Angron had lived a harsh life, being captured soon after his crash-landing. He had been
                    forced to partake in gladiatorial bouts, and had been implanted with a device called the Butchers Nails, which enhanced his aggression. Angron soon 
                    banded with his fellow gladiators and launched a revolt. Their rebellion was a doomed one, with the planetary rulers chasing Angron and his fighters. 
                    At their last stand, the Emperor, recently arrived, forcibly teleported Angron up to his flagship. Predictably, the rebels were slaughted, and Angron was livid. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The War Hounds were mustered to recieve Angron. When they arrived, the Legion's senior officers attempted to meet him. Angron, still wrathful, slew many. 
                    Ibram Ghreer, the War Hounds' Legion Master, was slain, and only Kharn, then Captain of the 8th Company, was able to calm him down enough to accept command. 
                    Angron, perhaps at the urging of his officers, renamed the Legion the World Eaters, for his gladiators had been known as the Eaters of Cities. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Angron quickly became a savage messiah, an ideal of martial honour and combat. The Legion's training regime became bloodier and more violent, striving 
                    to prepare the Legion for war. Under Angron's command, the World Eaters more than lived up to their name. Often, planets they were unleashed on became little more
                    than grave-worlds, their populations utterly slaughtered. The Legion's savage reputation earned them few allies, though Horus Lupercal and 
                    Jaghatai Khan were amongst these few.
                </p>
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The World Eaters prefer a simple, direct style of war. Their organisation reflects this. Their Echelons, the equivalent of Chapters, feature large numbers of 
                    line infantry, mostly composed of assault and tactical squads. These are supported by Terminator squads and Land Speeder units. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion are noted experts at conducting planetary invasion operations by drop-pod. Massed drop-pod attacks are conducted to bring large numbers of legionaries
                    directly into the heart of the enemy. This sudden, overwhelming attack is used to pin enemy units in place so that follow-on units of line infantry and armour can 
                    land and deal with strongpoints and other areas of resistance. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite a preference for hand-to-hand combat, the Legion is still capable of conducting armoured operations and ranged combat. However, these were only viewed a means 
                    of supporting the delivery of assault troops to the foe, rather than being a means of defeating the enemy themselves. 
                    The Legion's assault troops differ from other Legions' in that they often replace their swords and other weapons with deadly chainaxes, which have a greater 
                    ability to pierce armour.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is known for its high casualty rate both in combat and in training, and fatal gladiatorial bouts between legionaries are common. To maintain 
                    combat strength, the Legion is known to utilise accelerated recruitment and implantation techniques using the Primarch's own genetic material. 
                    To further enhance the combat power of their legionaries, the Legion often implants derivations of Angron's Butcher's Nails into recruits. Those who
                    become so unstable that they are unsuitable for line combat are transferred to the Rampager Squads. Within these formations are those so unstable that 
                    they have to be restrained between battles. These are the Caedere, or Butchers. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion has few allies, but amongst these is Forge World Sarum and the Legio Audax, the Ember Wolves. The Mechanicum of Sarum came to support the 
                    World Eaters after they saved the Forge from siege by Orks. The Legio Audax had developed a savage reputation of their own, and found firm allies 
                    in the World Eaters. Sarum fitted both the Titans of the Ember Wolves and the ships of the World Eaters with Ursus Claws - large harpoons that could
                    immobilise enemies. The World Eaters ships made excellent use of these, often dragging enemy ships into range of boarding actions. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The commanders of the World Eaters are more akin to tribal chieftains than officers. Often, rank is granted to the best combatants and those who display 
                    front-line leadership. The fractious nature of the World Eaters means that officers frequently have to enforce their orders with violence, and the penalty
                    for disobediance is a death sentence.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Gladiatorial combat is common within the Legion, and are conducted for many reasons. They are used to let off steam between warzones and settle disagreements
                    between legionaries. Legionaries can also challenge officers of higher rank for their command. Lastly, a warrior may challenge a member of Angron's bodyguard 
                    formation, the Devourers, for his place. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is able to muster approximately 60 capital ships, and something on the order of 150,000 legionaries, though their high casualty rate and corresponding
                    recruitment rate make this difficult to confirm. 
                </p>

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>The 14th Legion's first recruits came from Old Albia, and Albia is noted as supplying recruits to the 8th and 10th Legions as well, such was their suitability
                    Old Albia had been a major player in the Age of Strife - they had sported a powerful army, and, under the rule of the Unspeakable King, 
                    had even overcome the Panpacific Empire. By the time of the Unification Wars the Albians had become independent and had staunchly resisted the Emperor and 
                    his Thunder Warriors with their own Ironside regiments. The Emperor called a ceasefire and began negotiating with the Albians, even speaking to the 
                    warlords' Parliament. The Emperor delivered his vision of unity for Mankind, and to the shock of many, the Albians accepted. Their Ironside regiments
                    joined the Emperor's armies and the Albians sacrificed their sons to become Space Marines.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hence, the early 14th Legion took after the Ironside regiments, operating as heavy infantry and experts in survival and endurance. On the defence, they 
                    were immovable, and on the attack they were relentless, excelling at close-range firefights. During the Unification Wars, the 14th Legion became known as the 
                    Dusk Raiders, for their favoured tactic of attacking at dusk, when enemies were tired, and shadows gave cover to their advances. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Dusk Raiders soldiered on for some 80 years, relying on a quiet pride as other Legions were reunited with their Primarchs. Finally, they met their 
                    father on Barbarus. Only one record survives of those times, the <em>Stygian Scrolls</em>, authored by Lackland Thorn, a historian and poet possessed of 
                    a dark, cynical mind. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <em>Stygian Scrolls</em> say that Barbarus' human population had been ruled by a race of alien overlords. Barbarus was a mountainous world, and the 
                    aliens made their fortresses amongst these mountains, which were permanently shrouded in poisonous fogs. The humans clung to desperate life in the lowlands.
                    The aliens hunted the humans, and in the aftermath of one such hunt, an alien overlord found the Primarch-child that would become Mortarion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The alien took the Primarch for a son and heir, building a keep at the place where Mortarion could just endure the poisonsous atmosphere. 
                    Soon, Mortarion escaped to join the human population in the lowlands. He found them to be his kin, and swore vengeance on the aliens. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion laboured to gain the human's trust, and took to harvesting crops and building walls. After a time, the aliens attacked. Mortarion intervened, 
                    using his great harvesting scythe to slay the aliens. Mortarion became a leader to the humans, teaching them all he knew so that they might better 
                    defend themselves. However, the humans, no matter how hard they fought under Mortarion, could not win, for the air around the highest alien 
                    fortresses was death to them, and even to Mortarion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion developed crude respirators and formed an army of the toughest humans, whom he clad in armour, armed with swords and guns and dubbed the Death Guard.
                    With the Death Guard at his back, Mortarion slowly, grindingly, destroyed each alien fortress. However, Mortarion could not overcome the fortress held by 
                    his first father. It then that the Emperor arrived, and offered to help defeat the alien. Mortarion resented this, and soon a deal with struck - 
                    if Mortarion could defeat the alien alone, the Emperor would leave. If he could not, Mortarion would join the Emperor and swear fealty. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Predicably, Mortarion failed, and the Emperor intervened. Mortarion joined the Emperor soon after. Mortarion was given command of the 14th Legion, and 
                    said to them <em>"You are my unbroken blades, my Death Guard. By your hand shall justice be delivered, and doom shall stalk a thousand worlds"</em>. 
                    Mortarion plunged his Legion into endless campaigns, tearing down all who stood in their path and resupplying on the move. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion instituted a bleak creed of war - if Mankind were to be liberated, then they had to endure any hardship and must not shirk from any act, 
                    no matter how savage. If victory was the goal, then any means were justified. 
                </p>
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    Mortarion has formed the Death Guard to be the perfect infantrymen, and its legionaries can go anywhere, fight anything and win through with resilience 
                    and their own implacable aggression. Legionaries are well-rounded, trained to perform any conceivable infantry role, from heavy weapon bearers to assault 
                    troops. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion has equipped his Legion well, so that they can prevail against any foe. They primarily use boltguns, meltaguns and flamers, and this decision 
                    has been made to keep the Legion's logistical requirements as simple as possible. Rather than place the focus on weapons and vehicles, Mortarion places 
                    the focus on their wielders - the Space Marines will liberate Mankind, not their weapons. Mortarion has put it thus: <em>"One man may murder a world 
                    given sufficient time and the fortitude to wield the blade again and again and again until death's work is done"</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Death Guard's infantry sections are supported by well-armed support squads, and considerable numbers of Terminators and Dreadnoughts. 
                    The Legion, given their infantry-centric doctrine, does not place heavy focus on vehicles, but they do maintain decent reserves of armour, 
                    and can field armoured detachments, and particularly favour the Vindicator siege tank, the Fellblade super-heavy, and the Land Raider Spartan. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion himself is an excellent field commander, and the Death Guard are effective warriors under his command. The Legion's lines of authority are 
                    rigid - orders from superiors are to be obeyed. Internal dissent and rivalry is minimal, and officers are trained to be able to take up their superior's 
                    positions should they fall. This allows the Legion to remain coordinated and combat effective even when suffering heavy losses, which is common. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion imposes no restraint on his warriors when it comes to the more dangerous weapons of the Space Marine arsenal, such as chemical and radiological arms. 
                    This is partly a result of Mortarion's mindset, but also a result of the Legion's frequent deployments in hazardous environments, where the land is already 
                    contaminated and hence the use of such weapons carries no consequences. In these environments, the Death Guard excel, thanks to their near-legendary 
                    endurance, which is granted from Mortarion's genetic legacy and the unusual hardiness of the Barbaran recruits. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Death Guard, unlike many other Legions, often do not sport many decorations to their armour. Indeed, their outward appearance is often quite grubby, 
                    as it is a custom to leave superficial damage unrepaired as a mark of the legionary's hardiness. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is broken down into 7 Great Companies, and there are few other formations. Mortarion's bodyguard are the Deathshroud, whose recruits are often 
                    the last man surviving from a unit. The thinking is that these warriors have survived where their fellows have fallen, and thus proved their skill. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Death Guard rarely split into independent task forces, and as such, often bring their entire complement to war. They can currently muster roughly 95,000 men, 
                    a consequence of their high casualty rate and Mortation's unwillingness to recruit from other worlds, except in extremis. They can also call upon 70 capital ships. 
                </p>
