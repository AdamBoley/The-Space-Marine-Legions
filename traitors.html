                <h4>History</h4>

                <p>  
                    The Emperor's Children, being the 3rd Legion, were one of the first Legions founded by the Emperor. In their first years as an active military force, 
                    they recruited heavily from the noble families and aristocracies of the Europa region of Terra, after that area had been pacified by the Thunder Warriors. 
                    <hr>
                    The early 3rd Legion was not numerically strong, and so they often found themselves operating in concert with the Emperor's human armies, those regiments
                    and divisions that would go on to form the Imperial Army. Either because of the intelligence granted to them from their gene-seed, or perhaps 
                    because of their aristocractic orgins and the long traditions of military leadership associated with the nobility, the 3rd Legion excelled at this task. 
                    The Antarctic Clearance, the taking of Nadarin by the Bronze Host and the 5th Raising of Jove-Sat II are all the handiwork of the Legion.
                    <hr>
                    The 3rd Legion also found work as diplomatic bodyguards, dangerous tasks that the Legion were proud to carry out. As the Great Crusade progressed, the 
                    Legion reprised its role as leaders and planners by taking command of Imperial Army formations raised from newly-Compliant worlds. They carried standards
                    bearing the Emperor's Palatine Eagle into battle, preventing many of these Imperial Army units from running away. The Legion's iconic colour scheme of 
                    Imperial Purple comes from this role.
                    <hr>
                    One of the more famous incidences involving the 3rd Legion was the Proximan Betrayal. Early on in the Great Crusade, the Proximans had surrendered, and
                    the Emperor himself attended the Compliance ceremonies. The Proximans had planned a betrayal however, and deployed a devastating Vortex weapon to 
                    injure the Emperor. The 3rd Legion's 16th Cohort fought to the last man to evacuate the Emperor. In recognition, the Emperor granted the Legion the right
                    to decorate the chestplates of their armour with the Palatine Aquila, an eagle-shaped device. The Emperor's own standard was also granted to the Legion as
                    a relic. 
                    <hr>
                    Soon after the Proximan Betrayal, the 3rd Legion was plunged into crisis. A transport ship carrying some of the Legion's gene-seed reserve to Luna to set up 
                    a recruitment centre was destroyed, either by an attack or by accident. Whilst a blow, this was not necessarily fatal, as the gene-seed could be replaced
                    given time. Soon after, a viral attack swept through the gene-seed vaults of several Legions on Terra. Much of the precious gene-seed was lost, including all 
                    of the 3rd Legion's reserve. Now, with no way to replace fallen warriors, the 3rd Legion began to die. 
                    <hr>
                    The Legion was only saved thanks to the chance recovery of their Primarch, Fulgrim, from Chemos. Chemos had, like the Legion, been slowly dying. Fulgrim, by his
                    intellect and skill, had saved Chemos. Now, he could save his Legion. When father and sons met, the Legion numbered only 200 men. Fulgrim knelt before his Legion
                    saying <em>"You are the Emperor's chosen, his heralds, his warriors, his children, for this is only the beginning"</em>. On hearing this, the Emperor official renamed
                    the 3rd Legion the Emperor's Children. Fulgrim was able to provide pure gene samples, and with recruits from both Chemos and the nobility of other worlds, the 3rd Legion was able to begin to rebuild their 
                    depleted ranks. 
                    <hr>
                    However, the 3rd Legion was still tiny in comparison to other Legions, many of whom boasted enough men to handle multiple deployments at the same time. 
                    To get the Emperor's Children back into the Great Crusade, they joined the Luna Wolves of Horus Lupercal. The two Legions complemented each other, 
                    the Wolves' direct aggression balanced by the 3rd's speed and flexibility. Even when this association ended, the two Legions were bonded. 
                    <hr>
                    The Emperor's Children set out to master battle in all its forms. They studied other Legion's tactics and doctrines. In one case, when the Legion had 
                    collaborated with the Ultramarines to destroy the Orks on Mirga, Guilliman praised the Emperor's Children for demonstrating his own counter-attack 
                    doctrines better than the Ultramarines had. 
                    <hr>
                    However, this desire to master all aspects of war eventually led to both pride and resentment. When they excelled, they felt contempt for those unable to 
                    match them. When others were honoured for their own skills and achievements, the Emperor's Children became jealous. 
                    When both Legion and Primarch were enticed into betrayal is unclear, but whatever the cause and whenever it fell, 
                    it fell on ground made fertile by jealousy and pride.   
                    
                </p>

                <h4>Observations</h4>

                <p>
                    The Emperor's Children are a carefully organised and ordered military force. This comes from Fulgrim, who believes that excellent 
                    comes from considering even the smallest details. 
                    <hr>
                    The Legion has not deviated much from the organisational pattern laid down in the <em>Principia Bellicosa</em>, the 
                    manual of war for the Space Marine Legions. The Legion is broken down into 30 Millenials, the equivalent of Chapters of other Legions. 
                    <hr>
                    The hierarchy of the Emperor's Children is rigid. Each warrior is placed according to his strengths, and he is expected to excel in that area. 
                    Likewise, the Legion is not given to reorganising on the fly. Changes to organisation happen only after careful, patient consideration. 
                    <hr>
                    The Legion's squads show the most variance, and each has a particular purpose, and is given specialised training and equipment to fulfil that role. 
                    All of the various squad types extant in the Legions can be found in the Emperor's Children, which comes from their desire to master all forms of war. 
                    <hr>
                    Doctrinally, the Legion favours speed in all things - preferring the use of vehicles, bikers and jump troops on the tactical level. This comes from a
                    doctrinal belief that the warrior who strikes first will be victorius, and the Legion's battle honours lend this belief credence. The Legion favours this 
                    approach because their low numerical strength has never really allowed them to engage in attritional warfare, and Fulgrim desires a low casualty count 
                    to go with his victories. 
                    <hr>
                    On the strategic level, the Legion favours extensive planning, and its officers take into account every possible factor - logistics, the 
                    possibility of reinforcements, weather, the abilities of allied forces, and so on. This often makes for an effective approach to war, but it also renders them
                    inflexible - should unforeseen events happen, the Legion can be wrong-footed, suffering the consequences. 
                    <hr>
                    The Legion's command structure is as inflexible as its organisation. Directly below Fulgrim are the Princes of War, ten Lord Commanders who command the first 
                    10 Millenials of the Legion. The Princes of War lead Legion forces, Imperial Army regiments and other allied units on campaign. From the Lord Commanders, 
                    authority flows down to the Praetorate, the commanders who lead the rest of the Legion's various units. From authority flows down to the Centurions of the 
                    Legion's Companies, and from there to the Sergeants of the squads. 
                    <hr>
                    The Emperor's Children have a particular admiration, some might say obsession, for duelling, and many men of the Legion fight in duels. From this, the Legion's men 
                    are often particularly able swordsmen. The Charnabal Sabre is particularly favoured as a duelling sword, and the Legion in general has a habit of 
                    collecting trophy weapons from defeated foes. Many of the Legion's best Champions have extensive collections of swords taken from foes.

            <h4>History</h4>

            <p>
                The early 4th Legion's gene-seed was noted as being particularly stable and adaptable to a wide range of recruits, allowing it to both expand rapidly and 
                allow quick replacement of casualties. When Mars joined with the Imperium, war machines from the Martian forges flowed to the Legion as a reward for their
                victories. When the 3rd Legion's gene-seed reserves were destroyed, their recruits went to the 4th Legion. This rapid expansion in strength allowed the Legion
                to form several Expedition fleets. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As the Great Crusade progressed, and the Legion took and replaced casualties with recruits from other worlds, the Legion's ties to Terra quickly withered. 
                However, the Legion's organisation and doctrine remained unchanged. Their numbers and war machines allowed the Legion to meet its foes with overwhelming force. 
                They were tasked with fighting vital but inglorious campaigns, doing the drudge work of the Great Crusade. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Within 50 years, the Imperium came to Olympia, where Perturabo had crash landed. Olympia was a unique world with an interesting socio-political structure.
                Rather than having nations, the main political powers of Olympia were city-states. This was because Olympia was very mountainous - these mountains prevented the 
                city-states from developing large scale agriculture and hence population bases, and also prevented them from unifying into nations. As a result of endless wars over 
                resources, the Olympians became adept fortification engineers. Sieges hence became the primary mode of warfare.
            </p>

            <p>
                After crash landing, Perturabo spent some time as a wandering artisan and mercenary, before coming to the city-state of Lochos, ruled by the tyrant Dammekos. 
                Perturabo, his skills and ability evident, was offered a place in Dammekos' court, where he took command of Lochos' forces and developed new war machines to aid them. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When Perturabo was recovered, he was given command of the 4th Legion. At the time, the Legion numbered some 50,000 men, a low number given their ability to replace 
                casualties. The Legion had been taking many casualties in their campaigns, and in their most recent campaign to take Forge World Incaladion, they had lost 29,000 men, 
                a staggering number even during the Great Crusade. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Perturabo reviewed his Legion's performance and found them wanting. His punishment was suitably harsh - decimation. One in every 10 men was to be selected at random
                and then beaten to death by his brothers. Predictably, this went over poorly with the other Legions, who condenmed the waste of Space Marine lives. Guilliman
                in particular lamented the loss of several senior officers whom he had known and respected. Perturabo's reasoning was that the Legion had not achieved their full 
                potential, and that it had to stand superior to all others.
            </p>

            <h4>Observations</h4>

            <p>
                Perturabo calls his Legion the Iron Warriors, and since taking command has imposed his own stamp on the Legion. The Legion is broken down into Grand Battalions, 
                the equivalent of other Legion's Chapters. The Grand Battalions however function more like miniature Legions, each possessing considerable organic 
                armour reserves and logistical support. Each Grand Battalion includes units of the Tyranthikos, the Legion's Terminator elite. 
                Each Grand Battalion is then broken down into several Grand Companies, the equivalent of battalions. These are then split 
                into line companies, with vehicles organised into armour centuries.  
            </p>

            <p>
                The Legion is politically isolated, maintaining poor relations with other Legions, especially the Imperial Fists, with whom they share a penchant for fortification. 
                Rather than being a friendly competition, the Iron Warriors have made this a bitter rivalry. Perturabo and Rogal Dorn have considerable personal animosity. 
                The Iron Warrior's only real allies are the Mechanicum, as both value logic and technological ability. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Doctrinally, the Iron Warriors prefer siege warfare, and to aid in this keep the largest artillery division of all the Legions. They also possess 
                large reserves of tanks and other vehicles, particularly larger ones, such as Land Raiders, Fellblades and Mastodons. The Legion's excellent relations with
                the Mechanicum allow them to field larger than normal numbers of rarer vehicles such as Cerberus tank destroyers and Scorpius missile vehicles and 
                Thunderstrike artillery. Smaller, simpler vehicles such as Rhinos, Basilisks and Predators are available in huge numbers.  
            </p>

            <p>
                The Legion also fields large numbers of Destroyer units, and has little compunction about using them. These units are directed by the Stor-Bezashk, who
                are the Legion's siege masters and keepers of nuclear weapons and phosphex munitions. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Interestingly, the Legion contains a number of warrior societies, which function as symposiums to improve the Legion's combat craft and provide specialised knowlegde:

                <ul>

                    <li>The Dodecatheon is the Legion's fortification and strategic symposium. Historical battles are recreated in simulations, which are used by rival officers to 
                        settle differences
                    </li>

                    <li>The Apolokron is the Legion's symposium for the study of battle-automata, including the design, construction and use of such devices.
                        Despite good relations with the Mechanicum, the Apolokron has gone over poorly with the Legio Cybernetica, the traditional operators of 
                        battle-automata. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The Kheledakos is the Legion's symposium for space warfare, including studing the construction and employment of ships. The Magi of the Mechanicum 
                        attend the Kheledakos. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The Lyssatra is the Legion's symposium for the more unhinged members of the Legion, and they study the most terrible engines of destrution. 
                        The Lyssatra has a cult-like flavour to it, and rumour has it they dabble with xenos technology and occult ideology. 
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </p>

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>When they were first activated during the closing stage of the Unification Wars, the 8th Legion were deployed as a secret police. 
                    Those nations and cities on Terra that joined the nascent Imperium did not always do so willingly, and some of these failed to appreciate 
                    that the Emperor was bringing an end to the relentless wars of Terra. In these cases, the 8th Legion were deployed to quell the rebellion and enact retribution. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 8th Legion's Primarch, Konrad Curze, landed on Nostramo. Nostramo was a damned world - sunless and corrupt. Nostramo was part of a group 
                    of worlds that had retained the ability to travel the Warp during the Age of Strife. Nostramo was covered with cities and industry, and had wealth
                    in the form of valuable adamintine ore, which was mined and shipped to other worlds. Nostramo's industry and mining had poisoned the atmosphere, shortening the 
                    lives of its inhabitants. Murder was rife on Nostramo, and gangs ruled every square metre, from the highest towers of the nobility to the lowest slums. These 
                    gangs existed in a sort of feudal system, each owning fealty to a baron or count, who in turn served bosses who styled themselves monarchs and emperors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When Curze crash-landed, he was forced to survive alone - unlike other Primarchs, there was no surogate father for him. Rather than become an apex-killer, 
                    Curze decided to bring justice to Nostramo. At first, he hunted murderers and thugs, then entire gangs. Bodies were crucified on buildings as messages. 
                    A name of sorts began to follow Curze - the Night Haunter. When the barons and princes heard of this, they sent hunters after Curze. Most of these 
                    he killed, save a few he sent back to their masters with a simple message - <em>I am coming for you</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eventually, the whole of Nostramo had been quelled by Curze's fearsome displays. When Curze met the self-styled nobility of Nostramo, they surrendered to him, 
                    and he became ruler of the planet.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    After almost 100 years of the Great Crusade had passed, the Emperor came to Nostramo. Curze joined the Emperor, taking command of his Legion. 
                    The Legion's culture began to change. At first, these were minor changes - Nostraman became the language of the Legion, and as Nostramans were recruited, 
                    the customs and rites of the Nostraman gangs spread through the Legion. Officers began to adopt titles, much like the aristocrats of Nostramo. 
                    The Legion's purpose of bringing order from chaos did not change however, and the Nostraman recruits complemented the Terrans. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, once Curze left, the fragile peace he had imposed broke down. Nostramo continued to provide recruits, but these were gangsters already soaked in blood.
                    Thus, the Legion was slowly poisoned, with many Night Lords becoming simple murderers. Curze's leadership did not help matters, and many times Compliance actions
                    ended in populations being decimated for no apparent reason. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the last years of the Great Crusade, the Night Lords had become ever more distrusted by their brother Legions, always not far from being censured. 
                    The snap came when Curze confided in Fulgrim. Fulgrim broke this trust, informing Rogal Dorn. In the Cheraut system Curze fought and almost killed Dorn. 
                    Soon after, word that Nostramo had finally slipped back into lawlessness reached Curze. Near mad, Curze took his Legion to Nostramo and shattered it with 
                    an orbital bombardment.  
                </p>


    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>The Night Lords favour terror tactics, and often make use of these to undermine enemy morale and cohesion. This makes them particularly effective
                    when fighting human forces. This penchant for bloody violence is not just directed at their enemies however. Rivalry, often fatal, is endemic within the Legion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Night Lords are nonetheless a Space Marine Legion, and fully capable of fighting as one. All of the various specialised squads are present in the 
                    Legion's ranks, though units configured for siege operations are rarer. The Night Lords employ two unique squad types - the Terror squads, and the Night Raptors.
                    Night Raptors are the Legion's variation on assault squads, whilst the Terror squads do just that - spread terror amongst their foes. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The basic strategic unit of the Night Lords is the Company, with a strength ranging from 100 to 1,000. Most Companies adopted a title to go with their 
                    numerical designation, such as the 27th Company, called <em>the Shattered Skull</em>, the 104th Company, called <em>the Sable Brothers</em>, and the 71st Company, 
                    called <em>the Crimson Judges</em>. The higher level organisational units like battalions and Chapters were used as semi-permanent groupings for task forces, rather 
                    than as permanent units. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's command body is called the Kyroptera, a group hand-picked by Curze for their ability. These are the Legion's ruling elite, and are responsible
                    for leading task forces and organising the Legion's deployments. The Legion's Terminator elite are called the Atramentar, who are commanded by 
                    First Captain Jago Sevatarion. The Atramentar are famously loyal to Curze, and they are often used as enforcers to keep the more fractious elements
                    of the Legion in line. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Night Lords do not maintain large numbers of vehicles, but they are capable of fielding the full range of Space Marine tanks and transports. 
                    Rather than being held in reserve, the Legion's armour is often allocated to Companies directly, and a rare few Companies are capable of deploying as purely
                    armoured formations. When deployed, these formations strike hard and fast, often at night, and often choose to break through enemy lines to cut off supplies 
                    and encircle them. 
                </p>
