                <h4>History</h4>

                <p>  
                    The Emperor's Children, being the 3rd Legion, were one of the first Legions founded by the Emperor. In their first years as an active military force, 
                    they recruited heavily from the noble families and aristocracies of the Europa region of Terra, after that area had been pacified by the Thunder Warriors. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The early 3rd Legion was not numerically strong, and so they often found themselves operating in concert with the Emperor's human armies, those regiments
                    and divisions that would go on to form the Imperial Army. Either because of the intelligence granted to them from their gene-seed, or perhaps 
                    because of their aristocractic orgins and the long traditions of military leadership associated with the nobility, the 3rd Legion excelled at this task. 
                    The Antarctic Clearance, the taking of Nadarin by the Bronze Host and the 5th Raising of Jove-Sat II are all the handiwork of the Legion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 3rd Legion also found work as diplomatic bodyguards, dangerous tasks that the Legion were proud to carry out. As the Great Crusade progressed, the 
                    Legion reprised its role as leaders and planners by taking command of Imperial Army formations raised from newly-Compliant worlds. They carried standards
                    bearing the Emperor's Palatine Eagle into battle, preventing many of these Imperial Army units from running away. The Legion's iconic colour scheme of 
                    Imperial Purple comes from this role.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the more famous incidences involving the 3rd Legion was the Proximan Betrayal. Early on in the Great Crusade, the Proximans had surrendered, and
                    the Emperor himself attended the Compliance ceremonies. The Proximans had planned a betrayal however, and deployed a devastating Vortex weapon to 
                    injure the Emperor. The 3rd Legion's 16th Cohort fought to the last man to evacuate the Emperor. In recognition, the Emperor granted the Legion the right
                    to decorate the chestplates of their armour with the Palatine Aquila, an eagle-shaped device. The Emperor's own standard was also granted to the Legion as
                    a relic. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Soon after the Proximan Betrayal, the 3rd Legion was plunged into crisis. A transport ship carrying some of the Legion's gene-seed reserve to Luna to set up 
                    a recruitment centre was destroyed, either by an attack or by accident. Whilst a blow, this was not necessarily fatal, as the gene-seed could be replaced
                    given time. Soon after, a viral attack swept through the gene-seed vaults of several Legions on Terra. Much of the precious gene-seed was lost, including all 
                    of the 3rd Legion's reserve. Now, with no way to replace fallen warriors, the 3rd Legion began to die. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion was only saved thanks to the chance recovery of their Primarch, Fulgrim, from Chemos. Chemos had, like the Legion, been slowly dying. Fulgrim, by his
                    intellect and skill, had saved Chemos. Now, he could save his Legion. When father and sons met, the Legion numbered only 200 men. Fulgrim knelt before his Legion
                    saying <em>"You are the Emperor's chosen, his heralds, his warriors, his children, for this is only the beginning"</em>. On hearing this, the Emperor official renamed
                    the 3rd Legion the Emperor's Children. Fulgrim was able to provide pure gene samples, and with recruits from both Chemos and the nobility of other worlds, the 3rd Legion was able to begin to rebuild their 
                    depleted ranks. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, the 3rd Legion was still tiny in comparison to other Legions, many of whom boasted enough men to handle multiple deployments at the same time. 
                    To get the Emperor's Children back into the Great Crusade, they joined the Luna Wolves of Horus Lupercal. The two Legions complemented each other, 
                    the Wolves' direct aggression balanced by the 3rd's speed and flexibility. Even when this association ended, the two Legions were bonded. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Emperor's Children set out to master battle in all its forms. They studied other Legion's tactics and doctrines. In one case, when the Legion had 
                    collaborated with the Ultramarines to destroy the Orks on Mirga, Guilliman praised the Emperor's Children for demonstrating his own counter-attack 
                    doctrines better than the Ultramarines had. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, this desire to master all aspects of war eventually led to both pride and resentment. When they excelled, they felt contempt for those unable to 
                    match them. When others were honoured for their own skills and achievements, the Emperor's Children became jealous. 
                    When both Legion and Primarch were enticed into betrayal is unclear, but whatever the cause and whenever it fell, 
                    it fell on ground made fertile by jealousy and pride.   
                </p>

                

            </div>

            <div class="discussion emperors-children-div">

                <h4>Observations</h4>

                <p>
                    The Emperor's Children are a carefully organised and ordered military force. This comes from Fulgrim, who believes that excellent 
                    comes from considering even the smallest details. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion has not deviated much from the organisational pattern laid down in the <em>Principia Bellicosa</em>, the 
                    manual of war for the Space Marine Legions. The Legion is broken down into 30 Millenials, the equivalent of Chapters of other Legions. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The hierarchy of the Emperor's Children is rigid. Each warrior is placed according to his strengths, and he is expected to excel in that area. 
                    Likewise, the Legion is not given to reorganising on the fly. Changes to organisation happen only after careful, patient consideration. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's squads show the most variance, and each has a particular purpose, and is given specialised training and equipment to fulfil that role. 
                    All of the various squad types extant in the Legions can be found in the Emperor's Children, which comes from their desire to master all forms of war. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Doctrinally, the Legion favours speed in all things - preferring the use of vehicles, bikers and jump troops on the tactical level. This comes from a
                    doctrinal belief that the warrior who strikes first will be victorius, and the Legion's battle honours lend this belief credence. The Legion favours this 
                    approach because their low numerical strength has never really allowed them to engage in attritional warfare, and Fulgrim desires a low casualty count 
                    to go with his victories. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the strategic level, the Legion favours extensive planning, and its officers take into account every possible factor - logistics, the 
                    possibility of reinforcements, weather, the abilities of allied forces, and so on. This often makes for an effective approach to war, but it also renders them
                    inflexible - should unforeseen events happen, the Legion can be wrong-footed, suffering the consequences. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's command structure is as inflexible as its organisation. Directly below Fulgrim are the Princes of War, ten Lord Commanders who command the first 
                    10 Millenials of the Legion. The Princes of War lead Legion forces, Imperial Army regiments and other allied units on campaign. From the Lord Commanders, 
                    authority flows down to the Praetorate, the commanders who lead the rest of the Legion's various units. From authority flows down to the Centurions of the 
                    Legion's Companies, and from there to the Sergeants of the squads. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Emperor's Children have a particular admiration, some might say obsession, for duelling, and many men of the Legion fight in duels. From this, the Legion's men 
                    are often particularly able swordsmen. The Charnabal Sabre is particularly favoured as a duelling sword, and the Legion in general has a habit of 
                    collecting trophy weapons from defeated foes. Many of the Legion's best Champions have extensive collections of swords taken from foes.

            <p>
                The early 4th Legion's gene-seed was noted as being particularly stable and adaptable to a wide range of recruits, allowing it to both expand rapidly and 
                allow quick replacement of casualties. When Mars joined with the Imperium, war machines from the Martian forges flowed to the Legion as a reward for their
                victories. When the 3rd Legion's gene-seed reserves were destroyed, their recruits went to the 4th Legion. This rapid expansion in strength allowed the Legion
                to form several Expedition fleets. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As the Great Crusade progressed, and the Legion took and replaced casualties with recruits from other worlds, the Legion's ties to Terra quickly withered. 
                However, the Legion's organisation and doctrine remained unchanged. Their numbers and war machines allowed the Legion to meet its foes with overwhelming force. 
                They were tasked with fighting vital but inglorious campaigns, doing the drudge work of the Great Crusade. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Within 50 years, the Imperium came to Olympia, where Perturabo had crash landed. Olympia was a unique world with an interesting socio-political structure.
                Rather than having nations, the main political powers of Olympia were city-states. This was because Olympia was very mountainous - these mountains prevented the 
                city-states from developing large scale agriculture and hence population bases, and also prevented them from unifying into nations. As a result of endless wars over 
                resources, the Olympians became adept fortification engineers. Sieges hence became the primary mode of warfare.
            </p>

            <p>
                After crash landing, Perturabo spent some time as a wandering artisan and mercenary, before coming to the city-state of Lochos, ruled by the tyrant Dammekos. 
                Perturabo, his skills and ability evident, was offered a place in Dammekos' court, where he took command of Lochos' forces and developed new war machines to aid them. 
            </p>

            <p>
                When Perturabo was recovered, he was given command of the 4th Legion. At the time, the Legion numbered some 50,000 men, a low number given their ability to replace 
                casualties. The Legion had been taking many casualties in their campaigns, and in their most recent campaign to take Forge World Incaladion, they had lost 29,000 men, 
                a staggering number even during the Great Crusade. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Perturabo reviewed his Legion's performance and found them wanting. His punishment was suitably harsh - decimation. One in every 10 men was to be selected at random
                and then beaten to death by his brothers. Predictably, this went over poorly with the other Legions, who condenmed the waste of Space Marine lives. Guilliman
                in particular lamented the loss of several senior officers whom he had known and respected. Perturabo's reasoning was that the Legion had not achieved their full 
                potential, and that it had to stand superior to all others.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="discussion iron-warriors-div">

           <h4>Observations</h4>

            <p>
                Perturabo calls his Legion the Iron Warriors, and since taking command has imposed his own stamp on the Legion. The Legion is broken down into Grand Battalions, 
                the equivalent of other Legion's Chapters. The Grand Battalions however function more like miniature Legions, each possessing considerable organic 
                armour reserves and logistical support. Each Grand Battalion includes units of the Tyranthikos, the Legion's Terminator elite. 
                Each Grand Battalion is then broken down into several Grand Companies, the equivalent of battalions. These are then split 
                into line companies, with vehicles organised into armour centuries.  
            </p>

            <p>
                The Legion is politically isolated, maintaining poor relations with other Legions, especially the Imperial Fists, with whom they share a penchant for fortification. 
                Rather than being a friendly competition, the Iron Warriors have made this a bitter rivalry. Perturabo and Rogal Dorn have considerable personal animosity. 
                The Iron Warrior's only real allies are the Mechanicum, as both value logic and technological ability. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Doctrinally, the Iron Warriors prefer siege warfare, and to aid in this keep the largest artillery division of all the Legions. They also possess 
                large reserves of tanks and other vehicles, particularly larger ones, such as Land Raiders, Fellblades and Mastodons. The Legion's excellent relations with
                the Mechanicum allow them to field larger than normal numbers of rarer vehicles such as Cerberus tank destroyers and Scorpius missile vehicles and 
                Thunderstrike artillery. Smaller, simpler vehicles such as Rhinos, Basilisks and Predators are available in huge numbers.  
            </p>

            <p>
                The Legion also fields large numbers of Destroyer units, and has little compunction about using them. These units are directed by the Stor-Bezashk, who
                are the Legion's siege masters and keepers of nuclear weapons and phosphex munitions. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Iron Warriors' senior officers are known as Warsmiths, who command the Grand Battalions. The Warsmiths are not mere combat leaders, but are expected to
                excel in all fields of war, include the Iron Warriors favoured fields of siege-craft and logistics. There is no defined seniority within the ranks 
                of the Warmsiths, and so there are often feuds and internal rivalries. Perturabo is unforgiving of failure, and so failed Warsmiths are frequently 
                disposed of. Thus, the Warsmiths are often intelligent, highly capable officers, if also paranoid, self-obsessed and distrustful. Three of the Legion's Warsmiths
                make up the Trident, who advise Perturabo, and are known as Triarchs. Membership is not permanent, and more than one Triarch has met with a grisly end at 
                Perturabo's hand for failure in battle.
            </p>

            <p>
                Interestingly, the Legion contains a number of warrior societies, which function as symposiums to improve the Legion's combat craft and provide specialised knowlegde:

                <ul>

                    <li>The Dodecatheon is the Legion's fortification and strategic symposium. Historical battles are recreated in simulations, which are used by rival officers to 
                        settle differences
                    </li>

                    <li>The Apolokron is the Legion's symposium for the study of battle-automata, including the design, construction and use of such devices.
                        Despite good relations with the Mechanicum, the Apolokron has gone over poorly with the Legio Cybernetica, the traditional operators of 
                        battle-automata. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The Kheledakos is the Legion's symposium for space warfare, including studing the construction and employment of ships. The Magi of the Mechanicum 
                        attend the Kheledakos. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The Lyssatra is the Legion's symposium for the more unhinged members of the Legion, and they study the most terrible engines of destrution. 
                        The Lyssatra has a cult-like flavour to it, and rumour has it they dabble with xenos technology and occult ideology. 
                    </li>

                </ul>

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>When they were first activated during the closing stage of the Unification Wars, the 8th Legion were deployed as a secret police. 
                    Those nations and cities on Terra that joined the nascent Imperium did not always do so willingly, and some of these failed to appreciate 
                    that the Emperor was bringing an end to the relentless wars of Terra. In these cases, the 8th Legion were deployed to quell the rebellion and enact retribution. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 8th Legion's Primarch, Konrad Curze, landed on Nostramo. Nostramo was a damned world - sunless and corrupt. Nostramo was part of a group 
                    of worlds that had retained the ability to travel the Warp during the Age of Strife. Nostramo was covered with cities and industry, and had wealth
                    in the form of valuable adamintine ore, which was mined and shipped to other worlds. Nostramo's industry and mining had poisoned the atmosphere, shortening the 
                    lives of its inhabitants. Murder was rife on Nostramo, and gangs ruled every square metre, from the highest towers of the nobility to the lowest slums. These 
                    gangs existed in a sort of feudal system, each owning fealty to a baron or count, who in turn served bosses who styled themselves monarchs and emperors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When Curze crash-landed, he was forced to survive alone - unlike other Primarchs, there was no surogate father for him. Rather than become an apex-killer, 
                    Curze decided to bring justice to Nostramo. At first, he hunted murderers and thugs, then entire gangs. Bodies were crucified on buildings as messages. 
                    A name of sorts began to follow Curze - the Night Haunter. When the barons and princes heard of this, they sent hunters after Curze. Most of these 
                    he killed, save a few he sent back to their masters with a simple message - <em>I am coming for you</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eventually, the whole of Nostramo had been quelled by Curze's fearsome displays. When Curze met the self-styled nobility of Nostramo, they surrendered to him, 
                    and he became ruler of the planet.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    After almost 100 years of the Great Crusade had passed, the Emperor came to Nostramo. Curze joined the Emperor, taking command of his Legion. 
                    The Legion's culture began to change. At first, these were minor changes - Nostraman became the language of the Legion, and as Nostramans were recruited, 
                    the customs and rites of the Nostraman gangs spread through the Legion. Officers began to adopt titles, much like the aristocrats of Nostramo. 
                    The Legion's purpose of bringing order from chaos did not change however, and the Nostraman recruits complemented the Terrans. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, once Curze left, the fragile peace he had imposed broke down. Nostramo continued to provide recruits, but these were gangsters already soaked in blood.
                    Thus, the Legion was slowly poisoned, with many Night Lords becoming simple murderers. Curze's leadership did not help matters, and many times Compliance actions
                    ended in populations being decimated for no apparent reason. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the last years of the Great Crusade, the Night Lords had become ever more distrusted by their brother Legions, always not far from being censured. 
                    The snap came when Curze confided in Fulgrim. Fulgrim broke this trust, informing Rogal Dorn. In the Cheraut system Curze fought and almost killed Dorn. 
                    Soon after, word that Nostramo had finally slipped back into lawlessness reached Curze. Near mad, Curze took his Legion to Nostramo and shattered it with 
                    an orbital bombardment.  
                </p>

            </div>
    
            <div class="discussion night-lords-div">
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>The Night Lords favour terror tactics, and often make use of these to undermine enemy morale and cohesion. This makes them particularly effective
                    when fighting human forces. This penchant for bloody violence is not just directed at their enemies however. Rivalry, often fatal, is endemic within the Legion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Night Lords are nonetheless a Space Marine Legion, and fully capable of fighting as one. All of the various specialised squads are present in the 
                    Legion's ranks, though units configured for siege operations are rarer. The Night Lords employ two unique squad types - the Terror squads, and the Night Raptors.
                    Night Raptors are the Legion's variation on assault squads, whilst the Terror squads do just that - spread terror amongst their foes. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The basic strategic unit of the Night Lords is the Company, with a strength ranging from 100 to 1,000. Most Companies adopted a title to go with their 
                    numerical designation, such as the 27th Company, called <em>the Shattered Skull</em>, the 104th Company, called <em>the Sable Brothers</em>, and the 71st Company, 
                    called <em>the Crimson Judges</em>. The higher level organisational units like battalions and Chapters were used as semi-permanent groupings for task forces, rather 
                    than as permanent units. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's command body is called the Kyroptera, a group hand-picked by Curze for their ability. These are the Legion's ruling elite, and are responsible
                    for leading task forces and organising the Legion's deployments. The Legion's Terminator elite are called the Atramentar, who are commanded by 
                    First Captain Jago Sevatarion. The Atramentar are famously loyal to Curze, and they are often used as enforcers to keep the more fractious elements
                    of the Legion in line. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Night Lords do not maintain large numbers of vehicles, but they are capable of fielding the full range of Space Marine tanks and transports. 
                    Rather than being held in reserve, the Legion's armour is often allocated to Companies directly, and a rare few Companies are capable of deploying as purely
                    armoured formations. When deployed, these formations strike hard and fast, often at night, and often choose to break through enemy lines to cut off supplies 
                    and encircle them.

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>Unlike many Legions, the 12th Legion's recruits were not drawn from any particular region or population. That said, those recruits underwent 
                    psychological screening to select only the most aggressive and competitive. This meant that from the outset, the Legion developed a reputation
                    as a highly aggressive force. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's first action was the Sa'afrik Liberation, where they acted as shock troops. They mounted unsubtle, direct assaults on enemy positions, 
                    compensating for their low numbers with courage and sheer violence. After this, however, the Legion was held in reserve, and saw little action. On those 
                    rare ocassions, the Legion performed well. It was during the Unification Wars that the Legion earnt its first name, the War Hounds, for their 
                    tenacious savagery in clearing out the Cephic Hives. The Legion adopted a red hound as their icon. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    During the very first actions of the Great Crusade, the War Hounds saw their first major action - a mission only they could undertake. The asteroid prison colony
                    of Cerberus, home to some 3 million prisoners, had risen up in revolt. Initial pacification missions were unsuccessful, and revealed that the revolt had 
                    been instigated by a band of Thunder Warriors calling themselves the Dait'Tar. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Led by Praetor-Commander Calyb Hax, the War Hounds launched their attack at 3:00 in the morning. By 8:00 in the morning, Hax signalled victory, and 
                    also that he had taken no prisoners. The War Hounds had been thorough and brutal, attacking directly, though often at great cost. Whilst the human 
                    insurrectionists were easily overcome, the Dait'Tar often dragged 3 or 4 War Hounds down the grave with them, a mark of the Thunder Warriors' 
                    own combat power. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Colonel Alves Scorn, leading follow-up elements, observed 
                    <em>"I do not doubt my Emperor's wisdom in creating a necessary evil such as these warriors, nor do I doubt their effectiveness in battle. It remains my
                    fervent hope however that though I spend my life making war for the liberation of Mankind that I never again see such inhuman butchery as I have witnessed in
                    the halls of Cerberus"</em>. 
                </p> 

                <p>
                    As the Great Crusade progressed, the War Hound found themselves broken up into several battle-groups, each boasting several thousand legionaries. The largest 
                    of these was the 13th Expedition, called the Bloody 13th. These battle groups acted as mobile reserves, directed to particularly fierce warzones. 
                    In these battles, the War Hounds acted with customary directness, conducting furious line-breaker attacks. Often, however, casualties were high, and 
                    it was not uncommon for War Hound forces to be slaughtered, though even in death they were often able to damage the enemy badly enough for allied forces to 
                    mop them up.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The War Hounds' inate aggression often had legionaries attacking either each other or allies who they deemed to have failed in battle. This necessitated 
                    their officers maintaining harsh discipline. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the other Legions grew in size and become more able to conduct operations without need of reinforcements, the War Hounds were increasingly tasked with 
                    annihilation missions. To facilitate this, the War Hounds disparate forces joined the 13th Expedition, and established a training base on Bodt. There, they 
                    were reinforced with other mistrusted Imperial forces, such as the Titans of the Legio Audax and the Numen Gun Clans. The Primarch Sanguinius is supposed to 
                    have had a moment of dry wit and said <em>"The Emperor is assembling a carnival for his amusement, although I doubt whoever he unleashes them upon will
                    see the jest"</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion was soon reunited with its Primarch, Angron, on Nuceria. Angron had lived a harsh life, being captured soon after his crash-landing. He had been
                    forced to partake in gladiatorial bouts, and had been implanted with a device called the Butchers Nails, which enhanced his aggression. Angron soon 
                    banded with his fellow gladiators and launched a revolt. Their rebellion was a doomed one, with the planetary rulers chasing Angron and his fighters. 
                    At their last stand, the Emperor, recently arrived, forcibly teleported Angron up to his flagship. Predictably, the rebels were slaughted, and Angron was livid. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The War Hounds were mustered to recieve Angron. When they arrived, the Legion's senior officers attempted to meet him. Angron, still wrathful, slew many. 
                    Ibram Ghreer, the War Hounds' Legion Master, was slain, and only Kharn, then Captain of the 8th Company, was able to calm him down enough to accept command. 
                    Angron, perhaps at the urging of his officers, renamed the Legion the World Eaters, for his gladiators had been known as the Eaters of Cities. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Angron quickly became a savage messiah, an ideal of martial honour and combat. The Legion's training regime became bloodier and more violent, striving 
                    to prepare the Legion for war. Under Angron's command, the World Eaters more than lived up to their name. Often, planets they were unleashed on became little more
                    than grave-worlds, their populations utterly slaughtered. The Legion's savage reputation earned them few allies, though Horus Lupercal and 
                    Jaghatai Khan were amongst these few.
                </p>
    
            </div>
    
            <div class="discussion world-eaters-div">
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The World Eaters prefer a simple, direct style of war. Their organisation reflects this. Their Echelons, the equivalent of Chapters, feature large numbers of 
                    line infantry, mostly composed of assault and tactical squads. These are supported by Terminator squads and Land Speeder units. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion are noted experts at conducting planetary invasion operations by drop-pod. Massed drop-pod attacks are conducted to bring large numbers of legionaries
                    directly into the heart of the enemy. This sudden, overwhelming attack is used to pin enemy units in place so that follow-on units of line infantry and armour can 
                    land and deal with strongpoints and other areas of resistance. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite a preference for hand-to-hand combat, the Legion is still capable of conducting armoured operations and ranged combat. However, these were only viewed a means 
                    of supporting the delivery of assault troops to the foe, rather than being a means of defeating the enemy themselves. 
                    The Legion's assault troops differ from other Legions' in that they often replace their swords and other weapons with deadly chainaxes, which have a greater 
                    ability to pierce armour.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is known for its high casualty rate both in combat and in training, and fatal gladiatorial bouts between legionaries are common. To maintain 
                    combat strength, the Legion is known to utilise accelerated recruitment and implantation techniques using the Primarch's own genetic material. 
                    To further enhance the combat power of their legionaries, the Legion often implants derivations of Angron's Butcher's Nails into recruits. Those who
                    become so unstable that they are unsuitable for line combat are transferred to the Rampager Squads. Within these formations are those so unstable that 
                    they have to be restrained between battles. These are the Caedere, or Butchers. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion has few allies, but amongst these is Forge World Sarum and the Legio Audax, the Ember Wolves. The Mechanicum of Sarum came to support the 
                    World Eaters after they saved the Forge from siege by Orks. The Legio Audax had developed a savage reputation of their own, and found firm allies 
                    in the World Eaters. Sarum fitted both the Titans of the Ember Wolves and the ships of the World Eaters with Ursus Claws - large harpoons that could
                    immobilise enemies. The World Eaters ships made excellent use of these, often dragging enemy ships into range of boarding actions. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The commanders of the World Eaters are more akin to tribal chieftains than officers. Often, rank is granted to the best combatants and those who display 
                    front-line leadership. The fractious nature of the World Eaters means that officers frequently have to enforce their orders with violence, and the penalty
                    for disobediance is a death sentence.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Gladiatorial combat is common within the Legion, and are conducted for many reasons. They are used to let off steam between warzones and settle disagreements
                    between legionaries. Legionaries can also challenge officers of higher rank for their command. Lastly, a warrior may challenge a member of Angron's bodyguard 
                    formation, the Devourers, for his place. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is able to muster approximately 60 capital ships, and something on the order of 150,000 legionaries, though their high casualty rate and corresponding
                    recruitment rate make this difficult to confirm.

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>The 14th Legion's first recruits came from Old Albia, and Albia is noted as supplying recruits to the 8th and 10th Legions as well, such was their suitability
                    Old Albia had been a major player in the Age of Strife - they had sported a powerful army, and, under the rule of the Unspeakable King, 
                    had even overcome the Panpacific Empire. By the time of the Unification Wars the Albians had become independent and had staunchly resisted the Emperor and 
                    his Thunder Warriors with their own Ironside regiments. The Emperor called a ceasefire and began negotiating with the Albians, even speaking to the 
                    warlords' Parliament. The Emperor delivered his vision of unity for Mankind, and to the shock of many, the Albians accepted. Their Ironside regiments
                    joined the Emperor's armies and the Albians sacrificed their sons to become Space Marines.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hence, the early 14th Legion took after the Ironside regiments, operating as heavy infantry and experts in survival and endurance. On the defence, they 
                    were immovable, and on the attack they were relentless, excelling at close-range firefights. During the Unification Wars, the 14th Legion became known as the 
                    Dusk Raiders, for their favoured tactic of attacking at dusk, when enemies were tired, and shadows gave cover to their advances. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Dusk Raiders soldiered on for some 80 years, relying on a quiet pride as other Legions were reunited with their Primarchs. Finally, they met their 
                    father on Barbarus. Only one record survives of those times, the <em>Stygian Scrolls</em>, authored by Lackland Thorn, a historian and poet possessed of 
                    a dark, cynical mind. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The <em>Stygian Scrolls</em> say that Barbarus' human population had been ruled by a race of alien overlords. Barbarus was a mountainous world, and the 
                    aliens made their fortresses amongst these mountains, which were permanently shrouded in poisonous fogs. The humans clung to desperate life in the lowlands.
                    The aliens hunted the humans, and in the aftermath of one such hunt, an alien overlord found the Primarch-child that would become Mortarion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The alien took the Primarch for a son and heir, building a keep at the place where Mortarion could just endure the poisonsous atmosphere. 
                    Soon, Mortarion escaped to join the human population in the lowlands. He found them to be his kin, and swore vengeance on the aliens. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion laboured to gain the human's trust, and took to harvesting crops and building walls. After a time, the aliens attacked. Mortarion intervened, 
                    using his great harvesting scythe to slay the aliens. Mortarion became a leader to the humans, teaching them all he knew so that they might better 
                    defend themselves. However, the humans, no matter how hard they fought under Mortarion, could not win, for the air around the highest alien 
                    fortresses was death to them, and even to Mortarion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion developed crude respirators and formed an army of the toughest humans, whom he clad in armour, armed with swords and guns and dubbed the Death Guard.
                    With the Death Guard at his back, Mortarion slowly, grindingly, destroyed each alien fortress. However, Mortarion could not overcome the fortress held by 
                    his first father. It then that the Emperor arrived, and offered to help defeat the alien. Mortarion resented this, and soon a deal with struck - 
                    if Mortarion could defeat the alien alone, the Emperor would leave. If he could not, Mortarion would join the Emperor and swear fealty. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Predicably, Mortarion failed, and the Emperor intervened. Mortarion joined the Emperor soon after. Mortarion was given command of the 14th Legion, and 
                    said to them <em>"You are my unbroken blades, my Death Guard. By your hand shall justice be delivered, and doom shall stalk a thousand worlds"</em>. 
                    Mortarion plunged his Legion into endless campaigns, tearing down all who stood in their path and resupplying on the move. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion instituted a bleak creed of war - if Mankind were to be liberated, then they had to endure any hardship and must not shirk from any act, 
                    no matter how savage. If victory was the goal, then any means were justified. 
                </p>
    
            </div>
    
            <div class="discussion death-guard-div">
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    Mortarion has formed the Death Guard to be the perfect infantrymen, and its legionaries can go anywhere, fight anything and win through with resilience 
                    and their own implacable aggression. Legionaries are well-rounded, trained to perform any conceivable infantry role, from heavy weapon bearers to assault 
                    troops. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion has equipped his Legion well, so that they can prevail against any foe. They primarily use boltguns, meltaguns and flamers, and this decision 
                    has been made to keep the Legion's logistical requirements as simple as possible. Rather than place the focus on weapons and vehicles, Mortarion places 
                    the focus on their wielders - the Space Marines will liberate Mankind, not their weapons. Mortarion has put it thus: <em>"One man may murder a world 
                    given sufficient time and the fortitude to wield the blade again and again and again until death's work is done"</em>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Death Guard's infantry sections are supported by well-armed support squads, and considerable numbers of Terminators and Dreadnoughts. 
                    The Legion, given their infantry-centric doctrine, does not place heavy focus on vehicles, but they do maintain decent reserves of armour, 
                    and can field armoured detachments, and particularly favour the Vindicator siege tank, the Fellblade super-heavy, and the Land Raider Spartan. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion himself is an excellent field commander, and the Death Guard are effective warriors under his command. The Legion's lines of authority are 
                    rigid - orders from superiors are to be obeyed. Internal dissent and rivalry is minimal, and officers are trained to be able to take up their superior's 
                    positions should they fall. This allows the Legion to remain coordinated and combat effective even when suffering heavy losses, which is common. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mortarion imposes no restraint on his warriors when it comes to the more dangerous weapons of the Space Marine arsenal, such as chemical and radiological arms. 
                    This is partly a result of Mortarion's mindset, but also a result of the Legion's frequent deployments in hazardous environments, where the land is already 
                    contaminated and hence the use of such weapons carries no consequences. In these environments, the Death Guard excel, thanks to their near-legendary 
                    endurance, which is granted from Mortarion's genetic legacy and the unusual hardiness of the Barbaran recruits. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Death Guard, unlike many other Legions, often do not sport many decorations to their armour. Indeed, their outward appearance is often quite grubby, 
                    as it is a custom to leave superficial damage unrepaired as a mark of the legionary's hardiness. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is broken down into 7 Great Companies, and there are few other formations. Mortarion's bodyguard are the Deathshroud, whose recruits are often 
                    the last man surviving from a unit. The thinking is that these warriors have survived where their fellows have fallen, and thus proved their skill. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Death Guard rarely split into independent task forces, and as such, often bring their entire complement to war. They can currently muster roughly 95,000 men, 
                    a consequence of their high casualty rate and Mortation's unwillingness to recruit from other worlds, except in extremis. They can also call upon 70 capital ships.

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>Much like the other Space Marine Legions, the 15th Legion was founded during the Unification Wars. However, they did not see active service, and remained 
                    inactive even as the Emperor's forces ventured out into the Solar system. The reason for this inactivity is that the first recruits were recruited very slowly, 
                    each personally hand-picked by the Emperor from the most loyal and stable nations of Terra, those first to join the Emperor willingly, such as the 
                    Achaemenid Empire. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When they were first activated, they numbered one thousand men, and thus the Emperor named them the Thousand Sons. When they joined the Great Crusade and fought 
                    their first battles, they displayed an uncommon level of synchronisation and coordination, and expanded their ranks only slowly. After a decade of service, 
                    the first legionaries began to manifest psychic powers. This was the reason for their slow recruitment and growth - the Sons were psykers to a man, and 
                    potent ones too. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Up to this point, battle-psykers had been rare in the Emperor's armies, and were often the tools of his enemies. Indeed, many of the warlords of 
                    the Age of Strife had been psykers. This caused the Thousand Sons to be distrusted by their brother Legions, who fought using more conventional means. 
                    Brother Legions refused to fight alongside the Sons. Despite this hostility, the Sons proved to be effective warriors, and their 
                    low numbers proved to be no obstacle. Their victories were quick and clean.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, tradegy was soon to strike. On Bezant in 823.M30, the Legion fought a native population with many psykers, and the war was both psychic and conventional. 
                    The clashing psychic energies gave rise to storms, inclement weather and many other psychic phenomena. 
                    In the midst of the battle, as the Legion strove to win through, a warrior began to mutate horribly. Horrified of this, his brothers torn him apart with 
                    bolter fire and incinerated the remains. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This proved not to be one isolated incident, and more warriors began to fall to this Flesh Change. Word leaked out despite the Legion's best efforts
                    to contain it, and those officials who knew thought it was related to flawed gene-seed. This was not unknown, as the Thunder Warriors, prior to their 
                    culling had suffered from cellular degeneration. The Legion became erratic, and those Imperial Army units fighting alongside them suffered 
                    high casualty rates, and in retrospect, this may be explained by the Sons desperately trying to silence witnesses to the Flesh Change.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    As rumours abounded, the Sons were condemned. Some called for the Legion to be euthanised, other for a purge, with every warrior culled and the Legion
                    struck from the records. At this point, the Flesh Change was wreaking havoc on the Legion. It had never been numerous, and was now suffering terrible 
                    casualties. However, even as warriors fell, the survivors found their powers lifted to new heights. As the Legion teetered on the edge of oblivion, 
                    it arrived at Prospero, and its future father, Magnus
                </p>

                <p>
                    Prospero had once been heavily populated, but during the Age of Strife the number of psykers increased greatly, and in time, entire cities and their populations
                    were destroyed. The survivors were hunted by the psychneuein, a breed of predators who reproductive cycle involved laying eggs in the brains of psykers. 
                    The survivors fled to the city of Tizca, where they were able to hold out. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When Magnus crash-landed on Prospero, he did so in Tizca. He was adopted by Amon, a tutor and would-be leader of Tizca. Soon, Magnus out-stripped Amon in 
                    the psychic arts, and Amon took to teaching Magnus wisdom, caution and humility. Magnus was soon the leader of Tizca, and he founded 5 cults of study. He 
                    led a Tizcan revival, rebuilding the great city. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the Emperor came to Prospero with the Thousand Sons, the Legion was but a few thousand strong, and even on Prospero the Flesh Change raged. 
                    Magnus bent all of his considerable learning to the task of halting the Flesh Change. Magnus was ultimately successful, but how is unknown. 
                    By the time the cure was in place, the Legion once again numbered only a thousand men. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Magnus recruited heavily from Tizca to rebuild the Legion, and instituted the Cults he had founded. Each psychically able warrior joined the Cult 
                    that most suited his talents. Most surprisingly, Amon and other men were able to join the Legion as a full Space Marines, despite being far past the
                    accepted recruitment age. This was accomplished through Tizca's technology and Magnus' own biomanic powers. 
                </p>

            <div class="discussion thousand-sons-div">
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    Most of the Thousand Sons are psykers to some extent, though their individual power and skill varies greatly. The Legion incorporates their 
                    psychic powers into their doctrine, using it even the odds. Rather than any particular doctrinal focus, the Legion most often deploys as 
                    mechanised Tactical Squads in Land Raiders, with reconnaissance provided by the speedier elements of the Space Marine armoury. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion tries to fight intelligently, relying on their powers, planning and foresight over conventional mass assault. Due to the danger involved, 
                    the Legion does not favour drop-pod assaults, and instead chooses to deliver units via gunships. As a result, they maintain a large reserve of such 
                    vessels. The Legion's tanks and other vehicles are organised into dedicated units, which are parcelled out as needed. In general, the vehicles of 
                    the Legion tend to be decorated and ornamented with occult symbols. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's organisation is fairly conventional, with the largest sub-formation being the 9 Fellowships. These are further divided into Circles, and then
                    into Chantries. Rather than having a fixed strength, their numbers vary based on occult significance. Beyond the Fellowships are the Orders. 
                    The Orders are macro-military bodies that expand the martial capabilities of the Legion. These are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Order of Ruin are the Legion's siege, logistics and void war specialists. They are also the operators of the Legion's battle-automata. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Order of the Jackal are also known as the Measure of Life and Death, and contain the Legion's Apothecaries. Members of the Order guard 
                            the 5 Cult temples on Prospero. The Order is responsible for recruiting the next generation of warriors, and remembering the fallen. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Order of Blindness, called the Hidden Ones, are headed by Amon. These are the spies, infiltrators, scouts and interrogators of the Legion. 
                            The Order also controls the deployment of the few Destroyers present in the Legion. 
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                </p>

                <p>
                    The 5 main Cults of the Legion exist to study the major psychic disciplines:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Raptora are the Legion's telekines - those psykers who manipulate the world with telekenesis. They provide the Legion's finest 
                            scholars and theoreticians, and are noted for their abilities in reasoning and logic. Their master is Phosis T'kar, Magistus of the 2nd Fellowship.  
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Pavoni are the Legion's biomancers and electrokines - these warriors can fire bolts of electricity and manipulate flesh with ease. 
                            Many of the Legion's Apothecaries are of the Pavoni. They are said to hold the passion and heart of the Legion, and are noted orators and 
                            experts in doctrine. Their master is Hathor Maat, Magistus of the 3rd Fellowship. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Corvidae are the Legion's seers - these warriors can see the many paths of the future and select the correct course of action. 
                            Given their abilities, the Corvidae provide the Legion's best strategists and field commanders. Their master is Ahzek Ahriman, Magistus of 
                            the 1st Fellowship.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Athaneans are the Legion's telepaths - these men can communicate silently over great distances, and can also ferret out the truth. 
                            Their abilities often see them act as emissaries. Their master is Amon, Magistus of the 9th Fellowship
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Pyrae are the pyromancers of the Legion - these passionate warriors can incinerate their foes with fire. The Pyrae hold the pride
                            of the Legion, and provide its martial heart. Their master is Khalophis, Magistus of the 6th Fellowship.  
                        </li>
                    
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Fellowships, Orders and Cults are only the most visible layer of organisation of the Legion, and there are many hundreds of other philosophical salons 
                    and symposiums that study particular psychic disciplines.  
                </p>

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>
                    Despite being the 16th Legion to be founded, the Legion were one of the first active Space Marine Legions. During their campaigns 
                    in the Unification Wars, they won many battle honours. Their initial recruits came from peoples on the desolate margins of civilisation, such as the 
                    Jutigran hunter-clans and the Samsatian slums. These were tough, hard-bitten, ruthless people, and these characteristics carried over into the early 16th 
                    Legion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion made war with swift and overwhelming aggression. They were frequently deployed to both end wars and start them. 
                    Chief amongst their campaigns was their shock assault on Luna at the close of the Unification Wars. 
                    From this, they earnt their first name - the Luna Wolves. Indeed, the Legion took on the symbolism of wolves, and officers frequently wore wolf pelts. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Luna Wolves were the first Legion to be reunited with their Primarch. Horus had crash-landed on Cthonia. Cthonia was a mining world, and thanks to 
                    an angry star, most lived underground. Cthonia's mines had long since been exhausted, and civil authority had collapsed. Gangs of killers roamed the mines. 
                    Cthonia was relatively close to Terra, close enough that some contact could be maintained even before the Emperor brought unity. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thanks to their capture of Luna and the gene-forged located there, the Luna Wolves were granted the most use of those forges. They married the hardened population
                    of Cthonia to the gene-tech of Luna and churned out warriors for their ranks, expanding in size rapidly. As the Cthonians replaced the Terrans, the Legion 
                    changed by degrees, the more ordered military tradition giving way to topknots, mohawks and personalised armour. Officers came to command through charisma and 
                    reputation, much like the chieftains of the Cthonian gangs. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For two hundred years and in tens of thousands of battles, Horus and his Legion pushed the borders of the Imperium outward. At Ullanor, the Emperor and Horus 
                    broke the greatest Ork empire then extant, that of Urlakk Urg. Horus slew Urg and in so doing saved the Emperor's life. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Emperor honoured Horus by naming him Warmaster, the commander of all of the Imperium's armed forces. Horus renamed his Legion in honour of this, calling 
                    them the Sons of Horus, and had them repaint their armour a deep sea green. 
                </p>

            <div class="discussion sons-of-horus-div">
    
                 <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The Sons of Horus favour the attack, and in the attack strive to apply overwhelming force as quickly as possible. Frequently, they will attack so quickly and 
                    then depart that enemies are left in a state of shock, their world turned upside down. Follow-on forces frequently have little trouble.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion shirks no approach to war, and all of the various units types may be found in their ranks. Vehicles and tanks are commonplace, and the Legion 
                    makes good use of these for their speed and striking power. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Horus is an especially adaptable commander, and is willing to innovate where necessary. After noting the effectiveness of the Imperial Fists' Breacher units, 
                    Horus has converted many squads to this template. Horus is also a backer of the Tactical Dreadnought Armour project, which has developed several types of 
                    Terminator armour, and Horus' Legion are well-supplied with these suits. That said, Horus prefers the flexibility of the Tactical squad, and often has them
                    take up additional melee weapons to help them break through enemy lines. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The primary strategic unit of the Legion is the Company, though unlike other Legions, this unit has no fixed strength, and no fixed organisation. These are 
                    determined by the needs of the campaign at hand, and the officer in charge. The First Company, commanded by First Captain Ezekiel Abbadon, is a small, elite unit.
                    It contains two formations, the elite Terminators of the Justaerin, and the elite assault units of the Catulan Reavers. Both wear black armour as a mark of their status.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Higher levels of organisation such as Chapters and battalions are not present. Where several companies need to be grouped together for a campaign or mission, they are commanded
                    by a senior officer, who is often given the rank of chieftain in the Cthonian tradition. Abbadon is the High Chieftain of the Justaerin.

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>
                    All of the Space Marine Legions were created to fight the Imperium's physical war, but only the 17th Legion was created to also fight its 
                    ideological war. The Emperor was fighting to end the influence of religion on Terra, and to impose a new order of rationality and truth. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 17th Legion drew its initial recruits from defeated enemy populations. These recruits were taught the crimes of their fathers, and how to earn 
                    the Imperium's foregiveness. As they say, there is no faith stronger than that of a convert, and so they 17th Legion served in penance and carried an 
                    air of zealotry. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Instead of a merely numerical designation, the 17th Legion were formally named as the Imperial Heralds from their activation. This stands in stark 
                    contrast to many of the other Legions, who were given names as a result of famous victories. The first Imperial Heralds would send a single emissary
                    to enemy rulers, wearing black armour and carrying an eagle-winged mace. This Herald would tell of the Emperor and his vision of unity, and then invite 
                    the enemy to surrender and recant their beliefs. Some would accept, and others would perfidiously assassinate the Herald, inviting destruction from 
                    his brothers. Whatever the case, in the aftermath, the Legion would destroy false idols, statues and temples. This practice earned them an informal
                    name - the Iconoclasts. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lorgar, the Imperial Heralds' Primarch, crash-landed on the desert world of Colchis. Lorgar led an often bloody campaign to bring his religion of 
                    Emperor-worship to Colchis, and by the time of the Emperor's arrival, had done so. When given command of the Legion, he formally recognised the Heralds as 
                    Chaplains, and renamed his Legion the Word Bearers, for their purpose would be bear word of the Emperor to all of Mankind. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the Word Bearers conquered worlds, they spent considerable time fully converting them to worship of the Emperor. As their pace slowed, the Emperor was 
                    forced to act. In 963.M30, Primarch Guilliman was ordered to burn the city of Monarchia on Khur, which the Word Bearers had brought into Compliance. 
                    The Word Bearers were brought to Khur and forced to kneel in the ashes of the city. The Emperor forcibly rebuked Lorgar for his worship. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lorgar suffered a crisis of faith, and at the behest of his adoptive father Kor Phaeron and First Chaplain Erebus, ordered the Legion to undertake the Pilgrimage. 
                    The Pilgrimage was a concept taken from the Old Faith of Colchis, a journey to "the place where gods and men meet", a region of space where the Warp 
                    bled into real-space. There, the 7th Assault Company under Argel Tal made the Pilgrimage, where they were possessed by daemons. From then on, Lorgar was
                    determined to bring this 'truth' to all of Mankind, and to cast down the Emperor. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lorgar began planning in secret. On the surface, he feigned complaince with the Emperor's wishes, upping the pace of conquest. 
                    Meanwhile he began increasing the size of the Legion and purged the few remaining Terran legionaries.

            <div class="discussion word-bearers-div">
    
               <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The Word Bearers are a fairly standard Legion, both organisationally and doctrinally. They advance aggressively and directly in sledgehammer assaults. 
                    The Word Bearers also prefer to keep squads at peak strength where possible. Rather than field 
                    multi-role units, the Word Bearers tend to field Companies specialised to a certain battlefield role, such as reconnaissance companies, assault companies 
                    and so on. These Companies were often but not exclusiely 100 men strong. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Chapters are the only area in which the Legion deviates. Some Chapters are only 500 men strong, whilst others boast near 3,000 men. These Chapters form
                    the heart of an Word Bearers expedition. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's unique formation are the Ashen Circle squads. These are jump troops who embody the old Imperial Heralds mission of iconoclasm. The descend into 
                    the heart of the foe, burning all around them with hand-flamers and using their potent axe-rakes to catch fleeing foes. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is also frequently accompanied by auxililary forces, though these are more akin to mobs than proper military forces. Nonethless, they aid the Word 
                    Bearers in applying overwhelming force to a target. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Word Bearers have two lines of authority. The first is the conventional military one, with traditional officers directing the movements of the Legion. 
                    The second line of authority are the Chaplaincy, who are the spiritual heart of the Legion, tending to the ideology of their brothers. 
                    The Chaplains have their own hierarchy, with High Chaplains as superior officers. The entire Chaplaincy is commanded by Erebus, who is First Chaplain. The influence 
                    of the Chaplaincy is such that Lorgar is advised by both Erebus and Kor Phaeron. Chaplains hold considerable influence in the Legion, often dictating policy 
                    to line officers. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Word Bearers report that their strength is about 140,000, making them a mid-sized Legion. However, mass recruitment from conquered worlds and the use of 
                    accelerated implantation methods mean that this must be higher. It is even speculated that their numbers are in the 200,000 plus range, meaning that they 
                    can rival the Ultramarines for size.

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>
                    Per their numerical designation, the 20th Legion were the last to be founded. That said, their origins are shrouded in secrecy. When deployed in 
                    combat, they appear to have performed well, and also benefitted from a high gene-seed acceptance rate.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is known that the Legions went through several testing phases during their foundings, at each stage inducting more and more recruits. 
                    The last of these phases was called the Alpha phase, with the goal of creating a combat-ready force. This is where the 20th Legion may have taken their 
                    common name of Alpha Legion from, perhaps because they failed this stage of testing. 
                    Whatever the case, the Legion did not expand quickly, and was never assigned a region on Terra to recruit from, keeping their numbers low.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once the Great Crusade got underway, the 20th Legion disappeared from the historical record. Over time, reports of small actions 
                    by Space Marine units in non-Legion colours emerged. These actions were similar to internal security actions, such as espionage and assassination.
                    This is plausible - the early Imperium surely had many hidden enemies unhappy with the rise of the Emperor and their own often forcible 
                    integration into the Imperium. Perhaps the Alpha Legion were employed to eliminate these threats before they could take action?
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the Legion was first openly activated is a matter of conjecture. The Legion used a multitude of titles, names and formation identifiers, 
                    and members of the Legion had a habit of referring to themselves as "Alpharius" or "One of Many", further complicating the issue.  
                </p>
    
               
    
            </div>
    
            <div class="discussion alpha-legion-div">
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The Alpha Legion's combat doctrine is broadly one of subtlety. They favour infiltration, ambushes and assassination. 
                    This causes friction with some of the more conventional Legions such as the Death Guard, Ultramarines and Imperial Fists who disdain such a 
                    doctrine. The Thousand Sons, for reasons unknown, avoid them entirely. That said, the Dark Angels and Iron Hands appreciate the Alpha Legion's focus 
                    on ends over means. There is also the possibility that some Legions are merely jealous - the Alpha Legion have accomplished much 
                    in the short time since being openly activated, and sure more before that time. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is known to be headed by not one, but two Primarchs - Alpharius and Omegon. Little is known for sure of these Primarchs, 
                    but from what can be observed, their command style is extremely flexible and allows for considerable freedom of operation amongst their officers.
                    They are solitary figures, rarely working with their brothers. Their physical descriptions are varied - in some accounts they are little different to 
                    their men, in others they cannot be mistaken for anything other than Primarchs. What is evident, however, is that they are keen strategists and tacticians. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The accounts of the Twin Primarchs origins are varied. One account that is more believable has one of the twins leading a human fleet against the Luna Wolves'
                    flagship, the <em>Vengeful Spirit</em>, boarding the ship and fighting his way to Horus, who immediately recognised a brother. Another has a twin surviving on
                    a dead world until a band of mercenaries landed, with the twin killing the mercs and taking the ship. A third has one twin being taken prisoner by the alien 
                    Slaugth, with the Emperor spending long years undoing the damage. Yet another has a twin escaping the vortex that spirited the other Primarchs away, and remaining 
                    with the Emperor. It is possible that all of these are true to some extent, and each is merely a chapter in the life of one or the other. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite a reliance on the darker arts of warfare, the Legion are still Space Marines tasked with liberating the galaxy. When called upon to act 
                    openly, the Legion applies overwhelming force with its customary coordination and discipline. Tactically, the Legion is able conduct fast-moving combined-arms 
                    warfare, supported by assassination enemy leaders and ambushes of reinforcements and retreating units. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's reliance on the intelligence application of force and discipline is reflected in their training regimen - where most Legions select their recruits 
                    based on endurance and strength, the Alpha Legion trials require intelligence and cooperation to overcome. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's sub-units rarely possess a fixed numerical strength, and are often broken down and built up according to need. Aside from allowing tactical flexibility, 
                    this also serves to hide the Legion's numbers from observers. Strategic flexibility is also facilitated by their large armoury of vehicles. The Alpha Legion takes 
                    pains to ensure that their armoury includes the full range of Imperial vehicles, and they can field substantial numbers of even modern and rare vehicles, including 
                    those types manufactured by or for particular Legions. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    This carries over to their personal wargear as well, and the Legion is known to employ a considerable number of the modern Corvus-Alpha pattern suit.
                    Legionaries also have access to plasma weapons, volkite weapons and conversion beamers on a level that most others cannot match. To round this extensive 
                    armoury off, their fleet is also large and diverse. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's officers are capable battlefield leaders, though they often forego the role of bloody-handed frontline champion, and instead act as 
                    organisers who coordinate assets for maximum effectiveness. Large-scale Legion actions are coordinated by the Harrowmasters. Harrowmaster isn't a rank 
                    <em>per se</em>, but rather a designation given to an officer for a campaign.
