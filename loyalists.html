            <h1>The Loyalist Legions</h1>

            <p>Those Legions who remained loyal to the Emperor of Mankind, the Nine Who Stood, were were able to prevail against their traitorous kin 
                through tenacity and skill at arms. They were unique military organisations, each with their own combat doctrines, rich histories and specialised units, which
                combined to see them win the Horus Heresy. See below for a deatiled breakdown of these famous, hard-fighting organisations

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>As their numerical designation suggests, the First Legion were the first of the Space Marine Legions to be founded. Given the secrecy surrounding the 
                    Space Marine project, little is known of the First Legion's founding. What is known is that they were intended to act as a template for 
                    further Legions, and as such, no attempt was made to foster specific military or culture traits, not curb any eccentricities. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The First Legion's founding was started approximately a century before the end of the Unification Wars. Given the untested nature of the Space Marines, 
                    a great many test subjects were used to create a relatively small number of Space Marines. These recruits were acquired from diverse sources. Terra had suffered 
                    greatly in the Age of Strife, and so suitable test subjects - untainted male youths - were in short supply. Hence, recruits were acquired from 
                    slave traders, conquered territories and allied subjects. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a result, the First Legion's recruits did not bear any cultural or genetic traits that carried over from their origins. They were a blank slate, so to speak.
                    Hence, the sons of Francish and Albian infantrymen mixed with the heirs of Skandic berserkers, Anatolic cavalry and dozens of other martial cultures. 
                    In effect, the First Legion was a melting pot for all of the bloody-handed martial lore acquired by the nations of Terra during the vicious wars of
                    Old Night. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To further cement this, the first legionaries chose to discard their old names, and adopt the names of ancient military heroes. Hence, men 
                    called Tarchon, Gilgamesh, Heracles, Hengist and many others could be found, these names being drawn from Mankind's bloody history. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    These first warriors, not yet numerous enough to fight as a single force, were deployed alongside the disparate armies of the Emperor. As only Space 
                    Marines can, they fought with a singular unity and potency, which saw them called the Uncrowned Princes, or Crowns for short. This was an homage 
                    to the Emperor, who was essential Mankind's monarch. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over time, the Legion developed Hosts. The Hosts were not organisational sub-units, but rather informal bodies of warriors who adapted the doctrines of 
                    the military cultures they had been recruited from for use by the Legion. These Hosts were able to advise their commanders, and when
                    this was unsufficient, even took over command when situations called their particular skills. The Hosts were invaluable in allowing the Legion
                    to fight as a multi-role combined arms force. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Hosts were not defined or fixed - their numbers rose and fell over time. As other Legions were activated, they used the doctrines and tactics 
                    developed by one Host or another, making those Hosts obsolete. Some Hosts were destroyed as their doctrines proved inadequate. Over time, the Legion 
                    became a well-honed, highly adaptable army, its disparate warriors bound together by the Hosts. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The First Legion would go on to decisively prove their worth in battle in their first large-scale engagement in 668.M30. At Samerkend, 10,000 men from 
                    the First Legion joined with a few hundred from 4 other Legions, and assembled to face down the Udug Hul, a 200,000 strong army of gene-forged soldiers
                    led by the King of Akkad. Up until then, the Akkadians had proved resistant to the Emperor's armies. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The result was a total slaughter - within 10 hours, the Udug Hul had been taken apart. One of the Legion's senior officers, Hector Thrane, was made 
                    Grandmaster. Thrane was given the task of taking on the most horrific foes and eradicating them. To accomplish this, the Legion was given the run of 
                    Imperial Palace's armouries, which held all of the most terrible weapons recovered from Terra. The disappearance of the Thunder Warriors at Mount Ararat
                    is an event shrouded in secrecy, though it is hinted that the First Legion supported the Legio Custodes in this task. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the Imperium geared up to begin the Great Crusade, the First Legion was sent out to fully secure the Solar system - they were assigned to the Oort Cloud, 
                    at the very edge of the system. There, they recovered the last few lost human outposts, and kept watch for xenos incursions. At this time, with the Hosts 
                    mature, the Legion developed the Orders, who were small organisations dedicated to a single focus of war. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To begin the Great Crusade, the First Legion was issued with its fleet. These were the system's relic-ships, those advanced vessels developed by Mankind during 
                    the Age of Technology that had survived the Age of Strife. All of the Legions received some of these ships - the <em>Gloriana-</em>class battleships 
                    used as Legion flagships were some of these ships. However, the First Legion recieved the lion's share of these ships, enough to equip an entire fleet.
                    This was a necessity, as the Legion's mission was to eradicate the xenos races that opposed the Great Crusade's first steps. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    These eradication missions became the bread-and-butter of the Legion's participation in the Crusade, a stark contast to the other Legion's tasking 
                    to Compliance actions. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    By this point, the Hosts of the Legion had mostly solidified. These were :
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Host of Crowns were the oldest Host, and specialised in shock assaults, line breaking and vanguard operations, a hold-over from the Legion's 
                            earliest actions supporting Imperial Army formations
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Blades were the largest Host, and specialised in line infantry tactics - close-order formation, gun lines and mass assault. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Pentacles had experimented with battle-psykers. Failing as often as they were wildly successful, the Host was considered unreliable
                            and soon disbanded. However, their contribution was not small - when the Librarius departments were founded, they were done so in part using 
                            traditions developed by the Host of Pentacles  
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Iron were the Legion's armoured warfare experts. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Fire were the Legion's spies, assassins, interrogators and reconnaissance troops. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Bone were the Legion's berserkers - savage reavers who sought to terrify the foe. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Stone were the Legion's siege warfare and fortification experts.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Wind were the Legion's skirmishers and cavalrymen, who excelled in fast-moving warfare. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of the Void were the last Host to be formed, and specialised in void war, boarding actions and teleport assaults.
                        </li>
                    
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The First Legion became a fearsome weapon - they boasted large numbers of legionaries, many capable ships and a large armoury. 
                    However, this soon led to arrogance - their many victories made them complacent, and they were more than happy to put their few defeats down to 
                    inferior officers. Unchallenged, the Hosts stopped innovating new doctrines, assuming there was nothing more to learn. Tradition and ritual began to 
                    dominate. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, the Legion was facing the end of their primacy. The other Legions were becoming established formations with their own specialisms and 
                    doctrines. Several had been reunited with their Primarchs, and were expanding rapidly. These other Legions were forging impressive combat records 
                    with long rolls of victories. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    At Canis-Balor, the Legion suffered a major reversal. Four attacks did little more than inflict terrible casualties, including Grandmaster Thrane. 
                    The masters of the Hosts and Orders started to blame each other for the failure, sure that their own doctrines were sound. This stalled their attempts 
                    to elect a new Grandmaster, as none of the masters could support any of the others. The deadlock was only broken when Malcador the Sigillite intervened and 
                    sponsored a candidate - the lowly Captain Vendraig, an unaligned line officer with a worthy tally of victories. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vendraig's first task was to restore unity. He was soon presented with an excellent opportunity for this - the Imperium had encountered a terrifying 
                    new foe - the Rangda. In 839.M30, at Advex-mors, the Rangda had gathered a large fleet and built a gigantic war-moon. The First Legion gathered, and within 
                    4 months they had broken the Rangda, losing 5,000 men in the process. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, this victory failed to galvanise the Legion. Word soon arrived of another difficult mission. The world-fortress of Karkasarn had resisted Guilliman's 
                    Ultramarines. Grandmaster Vendraig led 10,000 men to Karkasarn, landed and launched a savage frontal assault. Suffering terrible casualties, the Legion 
                    was able to batter its way in. As the Legion was about to win, the masters of Karkasarn detonated an atomic weapon, killing Vendraig and his detachment. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The masters of the Hosts upped the pace of deployments, entering wars and ending them quickly though often at great cost, always seeking to reclaim their glory. 
                    It was no use, for the other Legions continued to rack up their own victories. 
                    This frenzy would likely have ground the Legion down in time, were it not for the discovery of Caliban and with it, their Primarch, Lion el'Jonson.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Little is known of Jonson's childhood. His first proper human contact was with a band of knights led by his future adoptive father, Luther. 
                    Luther assumed Jonson to be about 10 years old, but Primarchs are known to develop differently to normal humans. Indeed, there are legends that 
                    a man-sized forest spirit had been seen in the forests near isolated villages for nearly a century. Given that Jonson was recovered some 150 years after 
                    Primarchs had been scattered, there may be some merit to this. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Soon after his recovery, the Jonson became a knight. The people of Caliban were being slowly hunted to extinction by the great beasts of the forests.
                    The knights were only able to slow this down. However, Jonson proved to be an excellent strategist, technologist and warrior, and soon he was able to 
                    lead the Calibanites in pushing back the beasts. Soon after the last beast fell, the Emperor arrived to spirit away Jonson. 
                    Caliban was made the new home-world of the Legion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Lion, as Jonson came to be known, decided to reunite his far-flung Legion. He set out with 20,000 men, coming to each task force in turn. When he 
                    joined each force, he led them into battle, testing their mettle, and then had them swear brief oaths of allegiance. Within a few years, the Legion had been 
                    unified, and was some 100,000 men strong. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Lion's first campaign was a return to Karkasarn, where the subjuagted population had risen up against the Ultramarines garrison, beseiging them within the 
                    fortress. The Lion led 1,000 men to relieve the garrison and then set another 10,000 men to work purging the remainder. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Soon after, the Rangda returned in 862.M30. This proved to be a much larger incursion than the Legion's first encounter. The Lion proved instrumental, 
                    leading near 300,000 legionaries from 9 Legions against the Rangda for 10 years. The First Legion incurred massive casualties, and when the dust settled, they 
                    could muster no more than a tenth of their original numbers.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's next campaign was to Sarosh, who had joined the Imperium willingly at first, but then baulked and rebelled at the Imperium's demands. 
                    They attempted to assassinate the Lion, but failed. However, the Lion learned of some dissension in his ranks, and at the dissatisfaction of Luther. 
                    Luther and his men were reassigned to Caliban as its garrison. 
                </p>

                    The organisation of the Dark Angels is very complex. The first and most visible layer of organisation is the conventional military one, with Chapters, 
                    companies and squads. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The next layer is that of the Wings, which are carryovers from the Hosts. The Wings act as mini-Legions, each specialising in some broad aspect of 
                    warfare. Each legionary is holds a position in a wing, and interestingly a legionary's conventional rank is not related to his rank within his Wing. 
                    A legionary might be a lowly sergeant conventionally, but could hold a higher rank in his Wing. 
                    Within each Wing, each warrior may speak openly and discuss the business of the Wing, which helps the Wing continuously innovate and pursue excellence. 
                    The Wings are essentially carryovers from the Hosts, though there are only 6, and they are formed into the Hexagrammaton. These are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Stormwing are the largest Wing, and like the Host of Blades are composed of the Legion's line infantry. The specialise in complex 
                            manoeuvre under fire, keeping the Legion moving even under the most trying conditions. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Deathwing are the special operations force of the Legion, and specialise in line-breaker assaults. They also provide bodyguards to the 
                            Legion's officers. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Ravenwing are the skirmishers and scouts of the Legion, and also specialise in drop-pod assaults. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Dreadwing are the annihilation troops of the Legion, called upon when a foe needs to be eradicated. The Dreadwing are the home of 
                            the Destroyers and Moritats of the Legion, as well as many Techmarines. Dreadwing officers who have overseen the destruction of a world or race
                            are granted the title of Eskaton.  
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Ironwing are the armoured warfare specialists of the Legion, and also the siege warfare specialists, as they field many 
                            artillery pieces. Breachers, Terminators and Devastators are well-represented in the Legion. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Firewing are the assassins and champions of the Legion, and their role is to decapitate enemy formations by targeting commanders and officers. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Orders of the Legion are far more numerous and specialised. There are hundreds, and their specialisations are in narrow fields such as 
                    arctic warfare, anti-aircraft work and duelling. The Orders are called upon when Legion forces encounter a situation suited their skill-sets. 
                    When that happens, the Order in question calls its members and forms a cenobium, a specialised task force, to unleash whatever knowledge, experience or 
                    unique weaponry makes their Order special. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Orders are far more secretive that the Wings, and possess a hierarchy known only to their members. Membership involves secret rituals and ciphers. 
                    Only about half of the Legion can claim membership of an Order, as they are considerably more selective than the Wings. Their highly specialised fields 
                    require legionaries possessed of particular temperments and skillsets. A rare few legionaries can claim membership of more than one Order. One of these 
                    is the famed Knight Captain Atreus, who is a member of three Orders dedicated to swordsmanship, and his fighting style is a blend of the styles 
                    used by each, making him a deadly single combatant.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    One Order of particular note is the 500 Companions. These are the 500 men who first met Jonson on Caliban, and they have taken to protecting him in battle. 
                    Unlike other Primarchs, the 500 Companions were never formally named or formed by the Lion, but he silently acknowledges them by patiently waiting for them 
                    to assemble when he takes the field. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite possessing three command structures, the Dark Angels do not suffer from command confusion or paralysis. The three structures work in harmony to give
                    the Legion considerable flexibility and the ability to respond to changing battlefield conditions on the fly. Indeed, the three command structures give the 
                    Legion a deep pool of experience and commanders, so the Legion is rarely taken off guard by a enemy or deprived of direction when a commander falls. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Wings and Orders function in battle by commanders ceding command authority to the body that is most suited to the situation. For example, if enemy aircraft 
                    threaten the Legion, then the Order of Broken Wings will take over, and if an armoured attack is necessary, then the Ironwing will lead the way. 
                    The Dark Angels placed a great deal of trust in these formations, and as they are noted specialists, this flowing authority is effectively instinctual - 
                    it doesn't have to be called in any way. This system has proven extraordinarily effective, and allows the Legion to avoid falling back on 
                    gringing attrition - where an approach fails or stalls, the Legion simply shifts tactics to keep the battle flowing. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The deep pool of experienced officers allows the Legion to support many simultaneous deployments, each of which can operate independently. The Lion prefers
                    to engage in combat personally, though this doesn't hinder the Legion on the strategic plane, and their forces are more than capable 
                    of operating without oversight. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, the layered organisation is often confusing to outsiders and even brother Legions, whose lines of 
                    authority are often much simpler. That said, the Legion is known to use even this confusion to their advantage. Frequently, Legion groups will not 
                    present a single commander when meeting allied forces. Allied commanders will be watched and judged for who they choose to greet as a commander. Those who 
                    choose well, or are savvy enough to reserve judgement are given a measure of trust, whilst those who choose poorly are marked for scutiny and further lapses 
                    of judgement. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is not just the command arrangements of the Legion that make it effective. It is well-supplied in terms of personal weapons, vehicles and ships. 
                    This gives the Legion a significant edge. It can also field darker weapons normally forbidden to Imperial forces, such as gene-phages, exterminatus-grade 
                    munitions and nanites. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's holdings are minimal, restricted to Caliban and the industrial world of Gramarye, which is the meeting place of the Council of Masters. 
                    Several Orders maintain small bases and orbital installations, and these are used as resupply points. This means that the Legion primarily exists as a 
                    fleet-based force.

                <h4>History</h4>

                <p>
                    The first men of the Fifth Legion were recruited from the nomadic tribes of the Thulean Basin. Their mission was to act as the Emperor's pathfinders
                    and scouts. They were to find the hidden bases and holdfasts of the Emperor's enemies. The early 5th Legion were often widely dispersed, their men often 
                    operating in squad-sized units. In these scouting operations, the legionaries were tested in ways rarely experienced by the early Space Marines. 
                    Rather than enduring extended combat operations and injuries, the 5th Legion had to contend with areas poisoned by radiological weapons, plagues and the 
                    aftermaths of war. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    These operations formed the early combat doctrines of the Legion. Their limited numbers made massed attacks impractical, and their typical isolated deployments
                    precluded any sort of spear-head role. Instead, the Legion fought as skirmishers, striking at weak points and fading away, their goal to have their enemies 
                    distracted and weakened when the main forces of the Emperor arrived. Using the Thulean nomads as recruiting stock was an excellent decision - they had 
                    long possessed a reputation for stoicism, independence and cunning. They were hardened survivors, and yet also capable with technology. These traits carried 
                    over into the Legion, making them wilful and independent, and the only commanders who could control them were the Emperor and those who had 
                    previously earned their respect. Nonetheless, the Legion was regularly praised for its fortitude and intelligence. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the Great Crusade was launched, the 5th Legion was not formed into a a handful of heavy-hitting task forces like the other Legions, but was rather 
                    split into some 100 groups called Pioneer Companies. Each of these Companies was a mini-Legion, capable of extended independent operation. Each was set to 
                    follow Warp currents to seek out lost human colonies and xenos strongholds. One Company, that of Kornelius Dure, discovered Cthonia, the future 
                    recruiting world of the Luna Wolvs. Dure saw the nest of savagery that Cthonia was turned into, and recommended its destruction. Horus, when he 
                    found out about this, was amused, and often had Dure's Company act as his scouts. More largely, Horus often praised the Pioneer Companies for their 
                    service, and the Terran members of the Legion respected him for it.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion, widely spreadout across the stars, solidified its overarching combat doctrine of hit-and-run warfare. However, despite this, the Legion was often 
                    far from supply bases, and so was being slowly ground down. This continued for some 50 years, until Jaghatai Khan, their Primarch was unexpectedly returned 
                    to them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jaghatai had crash-landed on Chogoris, a minerally-rich world with a stable, untainted population, a stark contrast to many Primarchs, who had often landed on
                    inhospitable worlds. Jaghatai was, like many Primarchs, adopted by a human father, in this case a Khan, or leader, of a tribe. A rival tribe, called the Kurayed, 
                    attacked Jaghatai's tribe and slew his Khan. Normally, the Chogorian tribes would relatiate by conducting a raid of their own. Instead, Jaghatai gathered his tribe
                    and made total war upon the Kurayed, who were destroyed in a single night. Jaghatai, now Khan, pursued a campaign of unification, destroying or subjugating other 
                    tribes. Some others surrended and joined willingly. Jaghatai took measured to end the relentless feuding between the tribes, merging and splitting them. 
                    After a time, Jaghatai was made Khagan, or Khan of Khans.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another power dominated Chogoris, a settled empire, where Jaghatai's coaltion ruled the mountainous areas and the steppes. The son of the Palatine, the 
                    leader of the empire, was slain during an attempt to ambush Jaghatai. In response, the Palatine invaded Jaghatai's domain, and he countered by resorting 
                    to the tribes' well-practised hit-and-run tactics. Jaghatai attacked the empire, subjugating entire cities until he ruled all of Chogoris. A short while 
                    later, the Emperor arrived to reclaim Jaghatai. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jaghatai faced a difficult task in unifying his Legion. The Pioneer Companies had expanded to number some 800, and the Legion itself 
                    numbered perhaps 80,000, achieved through opportunistic recruitment. Widely spread out, with some acting as scouts for other Legions, each of the 
                    Companies had developed their own traditions, rituals and doctrines. Those operating alongside brother Legions had come to adopt some 
                    aspects of their culture. The Khan recalled his Companies, and recruited the first batch of men from Chogoris. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    It took nearly a decade from 865.M30 to recall the better part of the Legion, and some would rejoin to meet Jaghatai until the start of M31, some 135 years 
                    after the command had been issued. The majority, though, were called down to the Empty Quarter, the tribal area of Chogoris. Through Chogorian rituals, the 
                    Pioneer Companies were unified into the White Scars, a name acquired from Jaghatai's requirement that each warrior scar his face and adopt a new Chogorian name.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The White Scars were encouraged to study the Noble Pursuits of the Chogorian people - storytelling, hunting and calligraphy. These were to be the Truth of the Legion, 
                    their overarching culture. To bind the now unified Legion together more fully, the Khan led them into a campaign to subjuage the Kolarne Circle. Many casualties would be 
                    suffered, but through the campaign, the Khan taught his Legion that only as one Legion could they prevail against Mankind's enemies.
                </p>

                <h4>Observations</h4>

                <p>
                    The White Scars prefer a very mobile style of warfare. Despite their savage, tribal appearance, the White Scars are capable strategists, and are intelligent 
                    and insightful. That said, they do not conduct excessive planning or preparation, which often places them at odds with more inflexible Legions. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The White Scars are not traditionally disciplined, but are not wild. They value results over doctrine, and trust that their performance will vindicate
                    them when they clash with others. Culturally, they value courtsey and honesty over protocol. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Khan is an insular figure who finds friendship with few of his brothers. Of these few, the Khan favours Magnus for his honesty, integrity and pursuit of 
                    knowledge. Notably, Magnus and the Khan collaborated on the formation of the Librarius departments. He also favous Horus for his focus on results over 
                    doctrine. The Khan is a skilled combatant and strategist, and has a keen eye for the flow of battle. He embodies the doctrine of his Legion, placing himself 
                    in positions where he is both least expected and most effective.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion has never adhered closely to the organisation laid down in the <em>Principia Bellicosa</em>, and this remains true under the Khan. 
                    The Legion is composed of a number of Hordes, the rough equivalent of Chapters in other Legions, insofar as they are the highest level sub-unit. 
                    The number of Hordes varies - sometimes Hordes will combine, other times they will split. Hordes are commanded by Noyan-Khans, the most senior
                    warleaders of the Legion, and number between 5,000 and 20,000. Their frequent shifting of sizes and composition often causes logistics and assignment 
                    issues. It is rare for Hordes to muster their entire strength in one location, and even rarer for two or more Hordes to cooperate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below the Hordes are the Brotherhoods, the rough equivalent of Companies. These are commanded by Khans, whose preferences, reputation and charisma influence
                    how many men they can muster. Most Khans prefer the Legion's customary mobile style of warfare, equipping their Brotherhoods with either a large number of biker
                    units for skirmishing, or loading infantry in transports for fast dismount assaults. That said, some Khans use a siege, heavy weapon or artillery doctrine, 
                    equipping their Brotherhoods accordingly. These units are not disdained by the majority, and are in fact often honoured for sacrificing speed for the 
                    decisive firepower needed for victory in some tasks. Whatever their composition, most Brotherhoods include a Keshig, formation that acts as something 
                    between a bodyguard for their Khan, and an elite reserve. The Brotherhoods are the primary strategic unit of the Legion, and will commonly conduct 
                    operations by themselves.            
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion places great value on its Librarius department, and individual Librarians are called Stormseers, or <em>zadyin arga</em> in Chogorian. 
                    The Stormseers are well respected, and are often found advising their Khans. Rather than using the more overt psychic powers preferred by most 
                    Librarians, Stormseers support their brothers by impeding the foe with fog, rain, hail or monsoons. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whilst the Legion does field Destroyer units, they are not favoured, as their weapons often ruin the natural beauty of many worlds. White Scars Destroyers 
                    are known as <em>karaoghlanar</em> or the Dark Sons of Death. This formation is attached directly to the Stormseer council, and parcelled out to warzones 
                    only when deemed necessary. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion lacks both an elite formation and a disciplinary corps, though the <em>kharash</em> serve as both. Men may elect to join the <em>kharash</em>
                    to either expunge some stain on their honour or to gain fame and advancement. From this, the <em>kharash</em> typically undertake the most dangerous missions
                    such as diversionary attacks and shock assaults. They are also the primary users of Terminator plate, which suits their dangerous taskings. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's recon troops and head-hunters are called the <em>burgediin sarhvu</em>, or Falcon's Claws. The <em>uhaan solban</em> are the Legion's 
                    Dreadnoughts. Given the Legion's preference for fast moving warfare, the Dreadnoughts are rarely seen outside of Chogoris and Terra, where they guard the 
                    Legion's gene-seed repositories. The <em>akoghlanar</em> are the Legion's Apothecaries, who serve on an individual basis across the Brotherhoods. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion maintains its own titles for specialist officers. A Brotherhood's Khan will often designate a Kav-khan as his second officer. The Legion's 
                    ships are captained by Tenri-khan, and the Legion's Techmarines and Forge Lords are called Gan-khan. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The White Scars can currently muster around 95,000 men. 
                </p>

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The first men of the 6th Legion were recruited from some of the most violent and regressive groups to survive the Unification Wars, and recruits were 
                    chosen on an individual basis. Hence, much like the First Legion, the 6th Legion had no overall cultural imprint. Unlike other Legions, they did not see 
                    service in the Unification Wars. As a result, they did not acquire particular recruiting areas or any rewards, such as the extensive genetics laboratories
                    of Luna. Perversely, this may have saved them from the crisis that wiped out the 3rd Legion's gene-seed reserves and damaged the reserves of the 5th and 9th
                    Legions.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the Great Crusade got underway, the Legion was not openly deployed, and no one can say what happened in those years. This period of seeming 
                    inactivity ended after about a decade, when they were deployed to Delsvaan, a human colony. The Legion, then 3,500 strong, conducted a fast spear-tip style
                    operation. Their attack was savage and free-flowing - they reaved anything in their path and bypassed any target too well-defended to easily overcome. So bloody 
                    was their attack that it is suspected that Enoch Rathvin, their Legion Master, may even have lost control over his men. As a result of the Delsvaan action, 
                    the 6th Legion was granted their own Expedition Fleet.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's recruitment rate was low, and so they tended to support other Legions or Imperial Army force by conducting hunter-killer missions and urban combat. 
                    When leading Imperial Army forces, the Legion had a tendency to act as discipline masters, and for meting out summary discipline.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion of this period was noted for having a fractured hierarchy. Officers relied on their battlefield reputation, charisma and personal combat skill to 
                    maintain their position and enforce their orders. Battlefield executions were not unheard of.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion earnt a nickname from their battlefield doctrine - The Rout. This came from a perceived keenness to chase down fleeing foes, much like the predatory
                    carrion hounds of Terra who tormented bands of refugees. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Primarch of the 6th Legion, Leman Russ, crash-landed on the winter world of Fenris, and Russ' name was actually rendered as Leman of the Russ, the Russ being
                    the tribe that took him in. Russ' exploits are unknown, but unlike many Primarchs, he did not pursue a campaign of planetary unification, and when he was recovered
                    by the Emperor, Fenris remained a harsh, wild place with tribes constantly warring. When Russ joined his Legion, several hundred of his companions joined him as 
                    Astartes. As they were fully grown men, undertaking the implantation process would be an insane risk with a very high failure rate. Amazingly, many of 
                    Russ' companions survived, speaking to the incredible resilience of the Fenrisian people. Russ was also able to use his own pure genetic 
                    material to stabilise the implantation process, which solved the unusually high implantation failure rate that the Legion had been suffering from, leading 
                    to their low numbers. Russ' companions were known as the Varagyr, or Wolf Guard. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Russ' first campaign was the purgation of the Ork worlds of the Wheel of Fire. Russ capitalised on his Legion's strengths, undertaking a relentless series 
                    of shock assaults from multiple directions. Casualties were heavy - some 7,500 men, including Enoch Rathvin, leaving 15,000. After the campaign was complete, 
                    the Legion returned to Fenris, on which the Mechanicum had been busily constructing the Fang. The Fang was to serve as the Legion's base of operations, and was
                    outfitted with armouries and gene-forges. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Russ' first take was to expand the Legion. They recruited heavily from Fenris, and rumours abounded of the Legion bolstering Fenris' population with captives from 
                    feral worlds. To aid recruitment, Russ instructed his priests to spread tales through the oral story-tellers and skjalds of the Fenris. Through these, the Fang was 
                    made into the domain of the Fenrisian gods, and aspiring warriors were to travel there to serve as warriors for the Allfather. 
                </p>
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The 6th Legion's gene-line is given to producing fractious personalities. To counter this, Russ has instituted a savage martial culture that gives 
                    imparts discipline and control to his warriors. The outward appearance of this culture makes the Wolves appear savage and tribal - their armour is 
                    often bedecked with furs, leather and bone charms.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's overall combat doctrine is one of close quarters shock assault, and the bulk of the Legion are fast moving shock troopers. The Wolves are 
                    single-minded in battle - they will clinically target weak-points and bypass strongpoints. Heavier support from tanks and Devastators is concentrated into 
                    specialised detachments. This frees the Legion's line troops to move quickly. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is composed of 13 Great Companies, the equivalent of Chapters. Each Great Company is notionally 10,000 men strong, but battle attrition means 
                    that they are often understrength. There is no defined organisation below the Great Company. The Legion's officers, called Jarls and Thegns, 
                    control their own warbands within Great Companies, and their strengths fluctate with attrition and the leader's reputation. Warriors and squads may move 
                    freely between the warbands of officers. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The First Great Company is Russ' own, and is staffed with his own Huscarls and the Legion's Terminator elite. The 7th Great Company controls the Legion's 
                    specialised formations. These include the Legion's Destroyers, called the <em>landayvan</em>, "those who lay the land waste". The Legion's siege and artillery
                    formations are under the control of the 7th Great Company. The last unit within the 7th is the Black Cull, a cult that worships Morkai. The Black Cull are the 
                    true berserkers of the Legion, and are used as the tip of the spear in suicidal line-breaker assaults.

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>
                    Much like the First Legion, the 7th Legion was recruited from all across Terra. Recruits were selected on their tolerance for pain and their general 
                    endurance, and it is suspected that 
                    the processes used in the implantation processes either required pain, or were particularly painful. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 7th Legion was particularly concerned with conquest in the Emperor's name, where other Legions' focus might be on destroying his enemies. 
                    The 7th Legion was also concerned with holding onto their conquests, and preventing a back-slide into the anarchy of the Age of Strife. This gave rise to 
                    an particular expertise within the 7th Legion for fortification. After a conquest, the 7th Legion would raise hold-fasts and fortresses both to secure 
                    these territories against counter-attack, and to fore-stall any notion of rebellion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    After a time, the 7th Legion gained a name, the Imperial Fists. This came from a common saying regarding the Legion - <em>"The hand of the Emperor 
                    had descended and gripped the land with an unbreakable fist"</em>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 7th Legion's Primarch had crash-landed on the icy Death World of Inwit. Inwit is tidally locked to its star - the dark side is freezing, and the 
                    star-side is bright and only slightly warmer. The orbit of Inwit is thronged with ancient shipyards and stations. Thanks to its treacherous conditions
                    and incessant inter-clan warfare, the people of Inwit were both hardy survivors and capable warriors. Inwit had also achieved an uncommon status, having been 
                    able to navigate the Warp storms of the Age of Strife and begin forging an interstellar empire. This was already well underway when the infant Primarch 
                    came to Inwit. He was taken in by the House of Dorn, and named Rogal, giving rise to his common name of Rogal Dorn. Thanks to his abilities, Dorn soon rose 
                    to lead his clan and then the Inwit empire. When the Emperor arrived, the Inwit Cluster was incorporated into the Imperium. 
                </p>
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    When on the offensive, the Imperial Fists prefer an aggressive doctrine, fielding assault squads and vehicles. Attacks are supported by specialised 
                    support squads and Devastator squads. Devastator squads prefer to use lascannons for their accuracy and range, and missile launchers for their 
                    versatility. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is a strong proponent of the Tactical Dreadnought armour project, and fields large numbers of Terminator suits. Notably, they are one of 
                    the few Legions to make use of the tempermental prototype Illiastus-pattern assault cannon, a scaled-down version of the highly regarded Kheres-pattern 
                    cannon used by Contemptor Dreadnoughts.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Organisationally, the Imperial Fists adhere closely to the <em>Principia Bellicosa</em>. The first sub-unit of the Legion is a Chapter-equivalent formation 
                    variously named a Regiment, a Crusade or a Household. One of these is split into 2 battalions, and these are further divided into Companies. Their elite 
                    formation is called the Templars, who are the guardians of the Temple of Oaths on the <em>Phalanx</em>. The Templars are technically the First Company of 
                    the Legion, but are more of a Regiment-sized unit, and number around a thousand men. The Templars are recruited from across the Legion, and candidates 
                    must display not only impeccable skill at arms, but also the fiery zeal of a crusader. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's organisation is inflexible, with clear, unbending lines of authority. Orders are to be obeyed totally. Unlike many Primarchs, Dorn maintains 
                    no fixed cadre of advisors, and instead depends on the counsel of the officers of the formation he is fighting beside. The Legion's siege masters and 
                    fleet commanders are their best officers, and are usually assigned overall command of a theatre. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion recruits from defeated populations, and has been known to take every viable candidate on occasion. These intakes are formed into distinct units, 
                    and often have particular specialities. For example, the 356th Company were recruited from the Consus Drift, a deep-void agglomeration of ships, much like 
                    a space hulk. The 356th are some of the best boarding troops in the Legion, a legacy of the savage pirates and boarders of the Consus Drift.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's signature asset is their fleet, and they can field some 1,500 vessels, which is far more than any other Legion. The Legion has also taken 
                    oaths from other organisations that mean they can call upon many more vessels should they need. These vessels are also of high quality, as they are produced 
                    and maintained in the Imperium's heartlands, which have very capable shipyards. The fleet is also in excellent hands, its officers and masters being considered
                    some of the Imperium's finest void warriors. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rogal Dorn himself is a quiet, tactiturn figure, and has a reputation for honesty that shades into bluntness. This often aggravates his brothers, particularly 
                    Perturabo, whom is a bitter rival. That said, the Emperor favours Dorn and his men, and they often undertake tasks at his behest. They have also fought beside 
                    the Emperor on many occasions, and have been honoured accordingly.

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>
                    Few records exist of the early 9th Legion. Unlike their brother Legions, who were conquerors, the 9th Legion fought as ravagers, who swept away their foes 
                    in a flurry of savage close assaults. The Legion was commonly deployed to hazardous zones, and contended with terrain contaminated by chemical and radiological
                    arms. To maintain their numbers, the Legion recruited entire tribes of mutated humans. The gene-seed of the Legion proved very adaptable, and would often 
                    produce Space Marines who were tall and fair from this impure stock. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion possessed a dark reputation. Their men were often seen stalking battlefields for slain enemy champions and commanders, and then consuming their flesh. 
                    Whilst a bloody spectacle, this was a result of the men using their over-active Remembrancer organs to acquire the knowledge and skill of their foes, and this 
                    often proved decisive. In some cases, dead commanders provided invaluable information, and in other cases, raw recruits gained enough battlefield knowledge to become 
                    battle-ready. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the Unification Wars were ending, and the Emperor was turning his sights to the Solar system, the Legion was sent to Neptune to clear out the tunnels of 
                    xenos breeds and bring the human colonists there into the Imperium. 12,000 men descended into the Neptunian tunnels, and a bloody campaign was fought. Much of 
                    the Legion was lost, and recruits were taken from the colonists, and the Legion ended the campaign with their ranks fully replenished. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the Great Crusade began, the 9th Legion did not take a place on the glorious front-lines, bringing human colonies back into the fold. Instead, their taskings 
                    were often desperate holding actions. Their seemingly miraculous ability to replenish their ranks even after terrible losses earnt them to the informal name 
                    of the Revenant Legion. Reports from this era always mention the same cadre of officers, and this is commonly attributed to the same few men surviving. However, 
                    the reality was that these men died as well, and their junior officers would consume their flesh, learning their hard-won fighting skills and assuming their names and ranks. 
                    Notably, there were several Legion Masters, each taking the name Ishidur Ossuros, the name of the first such officer. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's doctrine in these early years was to conduct a sudden charge followed by a drawn-out attritional grind by close-assault infantry. Some units 
                    made use of their cannibalistic tendencies in battle, using the fearsome sight of a Space Marine eating his enemies to panic the foe. Their rather 
                    simplistic doctrine was partly derived from a reluctance by the Imperium to supply the more advanced weapons and vehicles then available to other Legions.
                    This was due to an increasing disrepute, and the Legion was increasingly falling out of favour with Imperial command.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 9th Legion's Primarch crash-landed on Baal Secundus, a moon of the Death World Baal. He survived alone for a time against the beasts of the moon.
                    At some point, he joined a tribe, called The People of the Blood, or The Blood for short. Sanguinius, as he was known, fought no war of unification or conquest, 
                    and instead many tribes joined his coaltion willingly. When the Emperor arrived, Sanguinius asked Baal to be spared the industrialisation that many Imperial worlds 
                    underwent when rediscovered. This was granted. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sanguinius did not immediately joined his Legion, and instead studied Imperial doctrine and tactics with Horus Lupercal. After a time, the 9th Legion was mustered 
                    on Teghar, and Sanguinius met them there. Sanguinius, seeing a mistrustful band of hardened killers, knelt before his sons, offering his allegiance. This simple 
                    act won their devotion, and Sanguinius' first campaign with his Legion was the purgation of Teghar Pentaurus. There, leading a suicidal counter-assault, 
                    Ishidur Ossuros died for the last time. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sanguinius recognised the savagery and bloodlust of his Legion as a reflection of himself, but he also saw a dimmed spark of honour and nobility. These, 
                    Sanguinius would use to reshape his Legion, and declared <em>"even though a darkness hangs over them, a future soaked in blood and horrow, they 
                    are angels yet, Angels of Blood"</em>. Thus were the 9th Legion renamed the Blood Angels. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the next decade, Sanguinius paired each one of his Legion's Companies with a company from the Luna Wolves. Horus and Sanguinius worked to instill a 
                    new sense of pride and discipline to the Legion. After this period of reforging, the Legion returned to Baal, where the first batch of fresh recruits awaited. 
                    Now redeemed and having shaken off their cloak of mistrust, the Legion gained access to the more modern Imperial technology. 
                </p>

    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The 9th Legion has never adhered to the doctrines of the <em>Principia Bellicosa</em>. From their inception through to their reunion with Sanguinius, the 
                    Legion fought as a barely organised mass of close-quarters assault troops. Their officers were bloody-handed warlords who commanded through threat of violence and 
                    battlefield prowess. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Sanguinius has reformed the Legion, imposing his own brand of order. The Legion now consists of 300 Companies, each roughly 500 men strong. Campaigns or taskings 
                    that require more than a single Company are assigned to Hosts, which are formed as needed and then disbanded. There is also a secondary layer of organisation consisting 
                    of three Spheres. These Spheres function more like a class system that anything else:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Outer Sphere, called the Malak, consists of the rank-and-file of the Legion, the legionaries who fight when and where they are directed.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Second Sphere are the officers of the Legion, from junior section leaders to the most senior Archeins. These men of the Second Sphere are tasked
                            with executing Sanguinius' will quickly and efficiently. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The First Sphere are the Immortals, and serve as Sanguinius' household. The First Sphere is recruited from the main body of the Legion, and upon 
                            joining, each warrior discards his name and takes up a new one. This serves to dedicate the warrior solely to Sanguinius' will, for warriors may 
                            be ordered to undertake distasteful tasks. When the period of service is completed, the warrior discards his assumed identity, and any burdens 
                            acquired in the process. Several orders exist within the Immortals:

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The first Order are the Ikisat, commonly called the Sanguinary Guard. These men are the bodyguards of Sanguinius, and are granted the 
                                    title of Seraph. On occasion, Sanguinius will lend a division of the Sanguiniary Guard to serve as bodyguards to a senior officer, which is 
                                    regarded as a mark of favour. 
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The second Order are the Keruvim, commonly the Crimson Paladins. These men are the guardians of Sanguinius' domains, and garrison the Legion's 
                                    flagship, the <em>Red Tear</em>. 
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The third Order are the Ofanim, called the Burning Eyes. This Order functions as the secret police of the Legion, watching for treachery and madness. 
                                    Once such a man is identified, they are removed. 
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The fourth Order are The Angel's Tears. These are the Legion's Destroyers, and are given the title Erelim. They are deployed when Sanguinius has deemed a 
                                    target to be unworthy of being saved. The other Orders being small in number, The Angel's Tears are the most commonly seen of the First Sphere. 
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                </p>

                <p>
                    The authority of each officer is strictly controlled, and each operates under direct orders. This offers less flexibility than other Legions, but 
                    also allows the natural blood-hunger of the Legion to be controlled and directed. Each Company is also well-staffed in terms of junior officers, who 
                    assist the Captain in directing his forces, and also stand as a reserve to take over command should the Captain be incapacitated. This helps stop any 
                    breakdown in discipline. Within the Legion, questioning orders is considered a grave sin, and legionaries are to only focus on their duty, not the 
                    blood-hunger. This free officers to focus on tactics and strategy. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Hosts are commanded by the Archeins, with Companies commanded by Dominions. Within Companies, the junior officers are called Powers. Any officer of the 
                    Legion may stand as an exemplar of his craft, and may be known as a Virtue, and so there may be an Archein of Wisdom or a Power of the Blade. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion currently numbers around 120,000 men, and doctrine focuses on close assault and drop-pod operations. Many warriors choose their wargear 
                    accordingly. The Legion's vehicles are typically those that support a speedy breakthrough role. These choices make the Legion less able in defensive 
                    operations, but the Legion prefers to attack where possible, making defensive actions rare. The Legion's fleet numbers some 300 capital class vessels, 
                    mostly those classes most able to conduct and support orbital drop operations with large hangar bays and bombardment cannon.

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>
                    In comparison to some Legions, the orgins of the 10th Legion are relatively well documented. Much like the early 14th Legion, the 10th drew their recruits 
                    heavily from Albia, and the Legion's culture was influenced by this. Throughout their early service, the Legion proved to be remorseless and 
                    fiercely disciplined force, operting with remarkable coordination. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's first major extra-Solar engagement, a battle that would go on to form the basis of the 10th's military doctrine, was the Battle of Rust. 
                    Rust, formally designated 02-34, had long been under Orkish control, as it possessed significant mineral resources. In 807.M30, just a few years into the 
                    Great Crusade, the 10th Legion attacked Rust, as part of a much wider Imperial push into the Ork-held Krooked-Klaw empire. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion was supported by an Imperial Army detachment of Urshan Velites and a Legion Cybernetica group. The 10th's Legion Master, Lord Commander 
                    Amadeus DuCaine, employed an old Albian doctrine called the Hammer and the Storm. The Urshan detachment landed in full strength in a desert wasteland, 
                    equally spaced from three large Ork settlements. Responding to this threat, the Orks mustered in their millions and attacked, thus <em>"raising the storm</em>. 
                    DuCaine waited for some hours until the Orks were fully committed, and landed his Legion via a massed gunship assault. The Legion's armour led the way with 
                    a mass of legionaries in close order behind. With relentless firepower, the Legion, in one huge force, massacred the Orks from behind. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    DuCaine then transferred his men to the defence, absorbing several days' worth of Ork counter-attack until the Orks simply ran out of bodies. The overall 
                    butcher's bill was remarkably low - less than a fifth of the Legion had been lost, and though many Urshan soldiers had been lost initially, they were spared 
                    further front-line combat, and so got off more lightly than they might otherwise have done. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion hence gained a reputation for highly coordinated warfare, particularly in set-piece battles prosecuted with combined-arms. Their doctrine was even 
                    copied by the 4th and 13th Legions. The Legion soon acquired a name, the Storm Walkers. However, any other development was cut short, as the Legion was one 
                    of the first to be reunited with their Primarch, on the world of Medusa. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Tenth Primarch crash-landed on Medusa, and like many Primarchs, had become an able warlord. Medusa was a harsh world, its thin resources and hard conditions 
                    driving its population to incessant warfare. However, the people had managed to maintain a considerable amount of technological ability, as many of Medusa's Clans 
                    made their homes on gigantic armoured mining crawlers. Medusa itself had also been a noted centre of technology, and much of that still remained.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Medusa was one of the rare few planets that had been known of prior to the start of the Great Crusade. This knowledge had come from the Mechanicum, who had 
                    maintained records of Medusa and its famed mineral wealth. Indeed, Medusa had been a high-priority target for the Great Crusade. The first Imperial vessel to 
                    visit Medusa was a Mechanicum scout ship. It registered Medusa's legendary Telstarax, an orbital station completely encircling the planet. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Medusa's population was a mixture of the native population from the Age of Technology and the remains of Mechanicum explorator fleets launched during the Age of Strife. 
                    Indeed, this is almost certainly the origin of the machine lore possessed by the Medusans, whose barbaric teachings carried an echo of the Mechanicum's Machine Cult. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Manus himself is thought to have crash-landed inside the dormant volcano of Mount Karaashi. At some point, he slew the great wyrm Asirnoth, whose quicksilver skin 
                    coated the Primarch's hands and forearms as it died. Asirnoth was almost certainly a mechanical relic of the Age of Technology. Manus joined with the Clans, binding them 
                    to his will and exchanging technological information. He led groups of Clan warriors to plunder Medusa's bounty, breaking open bunkers and vaults to claim the riches 
                    within.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Manus was soon granted control of the 10th Legion, and immediately instituted great changes. The intent was to forge the Legion into an engine of war, as 
                    direct and efficient a machine as possible. The Legion was soon renamed the Iron Hands, after the most visually striking aspect of their father. 
                </p>
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The Iron Hands are a highly structured miliary force, and a system of organised compartmentalisation has been implemented. Unlike other highly-structured Legions, 
                    the Iron Hands are more of a machine composed of many interlocking components, each specialised to a task and with its own duties and chain of command. The base unit 
                    within the Legion is the Company, each of which is specialised - there are infantry companies, armoured companies, support companies and so on. 
                    Companies are then formed into Orders. Orders are formed as needed for battles or campaigns, there makeup determined by the nature of the fighting. 
                    Each Order is an independent force, with its own command structure, logistics, support units and ships. Order are given a specific task, and the fighting 
                    units necessary to achieve those tasks. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Clan is the Iron Hands' equivalent of a Chapter, and in most cases one Clan will provide all of the the units for an Order, that Order essentially being a sub-unit 
                    of the Clan. That said, some Orders will be formed from two or more Clans, the units from one Clan competing with units from others for glory and achievement. 
                    When commited in their entirety, most Clans will form several Orders, designated Primii, Secundii, Tertiarii, Quarii and so on. 
                </p> 

                <p>   
                    The Clans themselves are directly linked to the Medusan Clans, and each Legion Clan recruits from their corresponding Medusan Clan. 
                    Legion Clans are effectively 'pocket Legions', each being fully self-sufficient and possessing a distinct cultural identity. The Clans compete for 
                    glory and Manus' favour, and also for resources, leading to an uneven distribution of resources across the Legion, with the most successful Clans having 
                    the most or highest-quality resources. Each Clan is led by a Clan Father. Of note, former Legion Master Amadeus DuCaine still serves as a senior officer, and is 
                    Clan Father of Clan Sorrgol. The largest and most favoured Clan is currently Clan Avernii. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Due to the highly organised nature of the Legion, it can be inflexible in battle, slow to change course, but nonetheless very difficult to stop once 
                    committed. Authority is invested in a few small number of officers, and orders are to be obeyed without question. This ensures that the responsibility 
                    for failure rests solely with those officers. These officers are empowered to both reward and discipline as needed, including immediate capital punishment. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion boasts around 113,000 men, making them a mid-tier Legion. However, this is balanced out by their extensive armoury of advanced weapons and vehicles.
                    These include graviton weapons, conversion beamers and Fellblade tanks, as well as advanced versions of more common vehicles, such as Predator Executioners.
                    Individual legionaries also tend to sport advanced cybernetic augmentations, the most prolific users of these being the Medusan Immortals, the elite boarding units of the 
                    Legion. 
                    These attributes grant them a greater combat power than raw numbers alone would suggest. 
                    The Legion's fleet is relatively large, consisting of perhaps 100 capital ships. The Legion contributed greatly to the Tactical Dreadnought armour project, 
                    and as a result of developments by Ferrus Manus fields the Gorgan-pattern suit, an advanced version of the common Cataphractii-pattern. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's overall culture is extraordinarily unforgiving of weakness and failure - it glorifies strength and achievement. This was instituted by Ferrus 
                    Manus, who learned these values from the Medusans - the harsh conditons of Medusa mean that the Clans cannot tolerate those who cannot contribute. This 
                    ensures that the best and brightest rise in the ranks. The harsh culture of the Legion also channels the natural aggression many legionaries 
                    display as a result of their gene-seed. 
                </p>

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The early 13th Legion was founded in the Unfication Wars, and early recruits displayed not only the expected heightened aggression, but also a marked tendency toward 
                    organisation, cohension and adoption of hierarchy, as well as an almost pathological dedication to achieving their goals. 
                    These first warriors were recruited from diverse sources - Panpocro, the Saragon Enclave, the Midafrik Hives and the Caucasus Wastes. The common factor was that these groups 
                    had all violently resisted unification, with their resistance ending only at the point of near-annihilation. This led to an informal appellation - the <em>War-born</em>.
                    Indeed, the recruitment of the Legion may have been used as a weapon itself, bleeding away potential rebellion by absorbing the savage Strife-era tribes of Terra.
                    It is telling that the Legion did not participate in the end-stages of the Unification Wars, their first battle honours being the Luna Pacification and the 
                    purgation of Sedna.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    During the Great Crusade's early years, the 13th Legion expanded rapidly, taking recruits from conquered human worlds in the heavily populated Segmentum Solar.
                    The Legion displayed a cold passion in war, with a mixture of the aggression the Space Marines are known for, but also restraint and discipline. This made them 
                    particularly successful in independent operations where they took command of allied Imperial forces. The Legion also proved pragmatic and adaptable in its doctrine, 
                    traits displayed in the 1st and 16th Legions, which were already accomplished formations.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the Great Crusade moved onward, the 13th began to develop its own character. They fought directly and practically, with little thought given to the more esoteric 
                    aspects of war. They also became competitive with other Legions, striving to out-do their achievements. Several 13th Legion units began to specialise in 
                    certain forms of warfare, adopting colours and iconography to reflect these specialisations. For example, those Companies who deployed alongside the Night Lords 
                    at the Cancerai Nebula took to painting their gauntlets black and the helms a midnight blue, calling themselves <em>Nemesis</em>. The armoured formations of 
                    the Legion who held the line against the Orks at Cypra Mundi called themselves the Aurorans for the aurora borealis the battle had been lit by. However, the Legion 
                    still lacked a formal name, a rarity in the Legions at the time. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 833.M30 the Legion numbered some 33,000 men, a large figure achieved through their low casualty tactics and their stable gene-seed. The Osiris Cluster, a 
                    group of 11 worlds brought into the Imperium by the 13th Legion, suddenly rebelled. The Legion Master, Gren Vosotho, vowed to right this stain on his Legion's 
                    honour. Vosotho gathered a fast strike force and moved directly on Septus XII, the Cluster's capital, aiming to topple the rebel leadership. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vosotho led the attack personally, inserting his forces into the capital city of Cabasset by gunship. The civilian population met them in a dead-eyed wave of bodies, 
                    the 13th switching to attritional warfare tactics. The Legion pressed on, taking their principal objectives and calling in reinforcements. It was then that a xenos fleet, 
                    having been concealed in the corona of the star, revealed themselves. Vosotho, bogged down, called a general retreat. The xenos ships were frightfully capable, ripping 
                    through Vosotho's fleet. Vosotho ordered that his fleet to withdraw immediately and carry word of these xenos to Terra. Vosotho, now trapped on the surface, transferred 
                    command of the Legion to Marius Gage, who strove to recover every gunship he could before retreating. Some 6,500 men had been lost in the battle, along with a quarter of the 
                    Legion's fleet. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    A few years later, the Legion learned that their Primarch had been recovered. The Primarch had crash-landed on Macragge, and had been adopted by Konor
                    Guilliman, a politician. In contrast to many Primarchs, the early life of Guilliman is well documented. Macragge was a bleak, yet hospitable world, with a 
                    society that had retained an authoritarian but cohesive society. Remarkably, Macragge still had access to a number of short-range Warp-capable ships. These, and 
                    the sub-light ships Macragge had continued to build, had allowed contact with nearby worlds to be maintained. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like all Primarchs, Guilliman's growth both physically and mentally was astounding, and by his tenth year he had mastered everything his tutors could teach him. Guilliman 
                    was soon granted command of an expeditionary force sent to pacify the wild northern area of Illyrium, a place of warring micro-states. Guilliman subdued the Illyrians 
                    masterfully, but upon returning to Macragge Civitas, he found rebellion. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Gallan, Konor's co-ruler, had launched a coup with the backing of Macragge's wealthy aristocracy. Konor had been gravely wounded by an assassin, and died shortly after Guilliman 
                    reached him. Guilliman quickly moved to put down the coup, hanging the rebels in the streets and restoring order. Soon after, Guilliman began transforming Macragge's social 
                    structure, enforcing a meritocracy where the hard-working prospered and technology was disseminated. By the time the Emperor arrived at Macragge, Guilliman was in the initial stages 
                    of forging his own interstellar empire. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Guilliman was reunited with his Legion shortly, and he quickly laid out his vision for the Imperium and the Great Crusade. After the defeat at the Osiris Cluster, 
                    this roused the 13th from their brooding. Guilliman began a root-and-branch reorganisation, defined by a thorough study of the Imperium's armed forces and 
                    his own Legion's accomplishments. Marrying his Space Marines to the goal of recreating Ultramar, Guilliman named his Legion the Ultramarines. 
                </p>
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    Since its inception, the Ultramarines have adhered closely to the <em>Principia Bellicosa</em>. The Legion is split into Chapters, each 10,000 men strong. Each 
                    Chapter is then divided into 10 Companies, each of 1,000 men. The Legion can currently field 25 full Chapters, making it the largest extant Legion with 250,000 men. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's doctrine favours diversity and the application of overwhelming force. Specialised units are not concentrated, but rather spread out across the Legion, 
                    the intent being that each Company be able to operate independently against any foe on any battlefield. To this end, each Company is almost a pocket Legion, 
                    with line infantry, assault infantry, armour, artillery, transports and gunships all working together. That said, this isn't universal, and some Chapters have deviated
                    in their doctrine and organisation so that they are more capable in certain fields. These are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The 4th Chapter are called the Aurorans, and can armour specialists, capable of mustering five times as many vehicles as other Chapters</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>The 22nd Chapter are called the Nemesis, and can field a large number of Destroyer units</li>
                    </ul> 

                </p>

                <p>
                    There are also three specialist formations within the Legion. The first of these are the Evocati, two double-strength Chapters responsible for training newly-implanted 
                    warriors. Here, the new recruits of the Legion get both practical battle experience and theoretical combat education. The second formation are the 
                    Invictarii, a veteran cadre serving as the Legion elite and as a pool of future commanders who display not just combat talents but also skills in organisation,
                    leadership and administration. The third body are the Vigil Opertii, a secret police of sorts formed to deal with internal threats to Ultramar's stability.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    In rather stark contrast to its numerical strength, the 13th Legion does not maintain a particularly strong navy. The Ultramarines can field between 30 and 35 battleships, with 
                    more available from the Imperial Navy through close alliances. The Ultramarines themselves are also not noted void warriors, and tend to excel in ground combat 
                    operations instead. The main strength of the Legion fleet is to be found in their large number of multi-role cruisers, which allows for both versatility and a large number of 
                    deployments. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion places great value in its legionaries being able to think their way out of situations, applying their experience and intelligence to achieve maximum effect. 
                    To this end, the Legion studies both the <em>'practical'</em> aspects of war - courage, discipline, skill and adaptability - and also the <em>'theoretical'</em> aspects, 
                    namely planning, analysis and assessment. Both are considered to be of equal weight, and inform the Legion's doctrine. 
                </p>

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The 18th Legion was founded separately from the rest of the Legions, along with the 6th and 20th Legions. Rather than participating in several smaller battles
                    as they built up their strength, the Legion was hoarded for a major offensive - the assault on the Tempest Galleries. 20,000 men were gathered for this operation, 
                    and though they were successful, they took extreme losses, with barely a thousand making it through. As the Great Crusade began, the Legion was rebuilt, their 
                    reputation ensuring they received many recruits and the most advanced wargear and vehicles. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    There was a pressing need for Space Marines in those early years, so as new Chapters were raised, they were deployed to hotspots. The 18th Legion were spread out 
                    across several different battle groups, and so rarely fought as a united Legion. The Legion's forces were often used as a fire brigade, responding to 
                    crises behind the front-lines of the Crusade, usually xenos raiders, space hulks and threats to colonisation efforts. As they were often the only 
                    Space Marine forces present, and in limited numbers, the 18th Legion grew accustomed to working with other Imperial forces in a command and spearhead role. As 
                    a result, they often faced the heaviest fighting against the most dangerous foes. Imperial Army units welcomed the arrival of 18th Legion forces, but also knew that 
                    hard fighting in holding actions and forlorn hopes was on the horizon. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nonetheless, the 18th took on these tasks with relish, always willing to fight to the bitter end. Indeed, some whispered of a suicidal streak in their thinking, as 
                    they seemed addicted to these kinds of asymmetrical battles against long odds. At times, this earnt them favour, and at other times scorn. These attributes 
                    ensured that they could never develop a large numerical strength. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 18th Legion's Primarch crash-landed on Nocture, a harsh Death World of fire, radiation and tectonic instability. It is minerally rich, but largely 
                    inhospitable to human life due to its climate and biosphere. Yet, human life survived - the Nocturnean people were noted for their hardiness and resistance to 
                    radiation, gravity and the extreme climate of Nocture. Their genetics were also remarkably stable. Their culture supported their natural toughness, 
                    with strong values of perseverance and courage.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    The infant Primarch was adopted by a Nocturean Black-Smiter, a metal worker in the settlement of Hesiod. He was named Vulkan, and as he grew he became both 
                    a famed artisan and a hunter of Nocturne's great beasts. Nocturne had also long been plagued by xenos raiders, called Dusk Wraiths, commonly known then as aeldari 
                    corsairs and slavers. Vulkan proved capable of defending his people against these raiders, who often hunted with impunity. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the Emperor arrived at Nocturne, he found that Vulkan had not become a bloody-handed warlord or king, as many other Primarchs had done, but a stalwart protector 
                    of the Nocturean people. Vulkan and the Emperor competed in Nocurean ritual trials, which ended with Vulkan swearing fealty to the Emperor. As with many Primarchs, 
                    Vulkan was not immediately reunited with his sons, and instead underwent a period of tuition with the Emperor, displaying a Primarch's characteristic intelligence and 
                    comprehension, but also a certain wisdom and compassion. Vulkan also displayed a noted ability as a technologist, studying with both the Mechanicum and Ferrus Manus. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When ready to assume command, Vulkan departed to joined his Legion. The Legion was defending the Taras Division against a large Ork incursion. After a year of tenacious 
                    but costly defence, the Legion had been trapped on Antaem, with Legion Master Cassian Vaughn badly injured. Vulkan brought some 3,000 men recruited from Nocturne to his 
                    Legion's aid, crushing the besieging Orks between the trapped Legion forces and the Primarch's reinforcements. Thus, the Legion was finally reunited with its Primarch. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vulkan took his Legion to Nocture, where a fortress had been raised on the moon of Prometheus. There, he renamed them the Salamanders, after the apex beasts of Nocturne. 
                </p>


    
                <h4>Observations</h4>

                <p>
                    Vulkan has instituted a cultural change within the Legion, converting it to his Promethean Cult, a cultural doctrine drawn from Nocturne's culture. At the centre of the 
                    Cult is the idea that the Space Marines exist solely to liberate and protect humanity, and to achieve that, each is both a physical and spiritual weapon. They are forged 
                    and honed in the fire war, much as a blade is forged on the anvil. The Cult teaches self-reliance, duty, loyalty, patience, awareness, self-sacrifice, self-discipline and 
                    endurance. The virtues of determination and the endurance of hardship are equally important, and to test themselves, it is common for Salamanders to overgo ritual scarring 
                    or branding. The Cult also promotes equality - whilst the Legion operates as a hierarchical military force in battle, when not in combat, each legionary 
                    is a brother, no matter the rank, and is treated as such. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    On the strategic level, the Legion is now split into seven Realms, each named after one of the seven major city states of Nocturne:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hesiod</li>
                        <li>Themis</li>
                        <li>Epithemus</li>
                        <li>Heliosa</li>
                        <li>Aethonion</li>
                        <li>Clymene</li>
                        <li>Skarokk</li>
                    </ul>

                    Each Realm is directly linked to its corresponding city-state, and draws its recruits from there. Each Realm is led by a Lord Commander, entitled as 
                    Protector, after their duty to defend their city-state from attack. This linkage has given each Realm a distinct cultural identity. This inevitably 
                    leads to competition between Realms. The small population base the Legion recruits from means that its numerical strength increases only slowly, though this 
                    is balanced out by the exceptional quality of the Nocturean recruits, who typically display a low rate of implant rejection. 
                    Each Realm is split into many line Companies, each with a complement of around 120 men. Their system of rank is simple and uncomplicated, and where ranks 
                    are the same, seniority is determined by length of service.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the core of each Realm are the Firedrakes, a body of veterans who have displayed excellence in battle, faultless bravery and perhaps most 
                    importantly of all, self-control. The greatest Firedrakes are inducted into the Pyre Guard, who are the personal bodyguard of Vulkan. More broadly, the 
                    Firedrakes are the leaders and instructors of the Legion, and are looked up to as exemplars of what a legionary should be. Mnay Chaplains are former
                    Firedrakes, the virtues of instruction carrying over well. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Salamanders are currently one of the smallest active Legions, and are able to field perhaps 89,000 men.
                    Doctrinally, the Legion prefers to mitigate its lower numerical strength by engaging its foes at close range. To support this, the Legion prefers 
                    flamer, melta and volkite weapons, which a short-ranged but powerful weapons. The Legion as a whole is also noted for its skill at artifice, and many 
                    of its weapons are superior to standard Legion arms, from the bolters of the rank and file to the heavy weapons of its tanks and Dreadnoughts. On a personal 
                    level, many legionaries customise their amrour and weapons, a common method being to drape the hide of Nocturean salamander or similar great beast over a part 
                    of their armour, usually a shoulder guard. This imitates Vulkan, whose own shoulder guard is decorated with the skull of the great salamander Kasare. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a result of this technological ability, the Legion can typically field a greater proportion of support weapons squads. Like all Legions, the Salamaders 
                    field a unique squad type. In their case, this is the Pyroclast squad, who wield prototype flame projector weapons that can compress their flame jets into 
                    cutting torches able to defeat the heaviest armour. The Legion's Terminators are also very well equipped, their skill at artifice having led to the 
                    production and deployment of storm shields that allow a Terminator to withstand even the heaviest incoming fire. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Salamanders also maintain the vehicle armoury of a much larger Legion, and though they can field the full range of armoured vehicles, 
                    they show a distinct bias toward tanks, gunships, assault rams and mobile support weapons, and a lesser focus on lighter vehicles, such as skimmers and bikes. 
                    Likewise, the fleet is of the highest quality, if not particularly large. One-on-one, a Salamanders ship can overmatch another vessel of equal tonnage. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion maintains good relations with most of the Imperium's factions, particularly the Mechanicum and the Iron Hands for their skill as technologists. 
                    However, there is considerable acrimony between the Salamanders and the Death Guard, since both often undertake operations in hazardous zones, but where the 
                    Salamanders prefer cleansing fire, the Death Guard most often turn to weapons that poison the earth, the former leaving a world capable of eventual colonisation, 
                    the latter leaving a world dead and uninhabitable. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Salamander Legion gene-seed displays, like the gene-seed of all the Legions, certain idiosyncrasies. That said, the Salamanders are more unique than most. 
                    Firstly, they are unusually strong and tough, their capacity to resist injury only surpassed by the Death Guard. 
                    Secondly, and perhaps most strikingly, many legionaries develop red eyes and dark, almost coal-like skin, a defensive response to high radiation exposure. 
                    This effect makes the sight of a Salamanders legionary particularly fearsome and distressing to humans, giving them an edge in battle.

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The early 19th Legion were quick to establish a reputation for a vastly different kind of warfare than many of their brother Legions favoured. 
                    The Legion was highly skilled in reconnaissance and target identification, and when the time came to unleash their warriors, attacks were conducted in a 
                    blindingly fast manner from unanticipated directions. 
                    The Legion were also noted specialists in the dark art of infiltration, and when they revealed themselves, most of the Emperor's enemeies chose surrender, 
                    their battle lines already penetrated and their units surrounded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first men of the Legion were recruited from the Xeric tribes native to the Asiatic Dustfields. The Xeric had proved to be capable warriors, though 
                    often displayed a streak of cruelty, for their martial culture demanded that subjugated peoples be watched closely for any sign of rebellion, for such
                    rebellions to be put down mercilessly. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 19th Legions first campaign was against the nation of Ursh in the central Asiatic region, ruled by the tyrant Kalagann. Rather than conduct an overwhelming 
                    strike in the manner of their brothers, the 19th infiltrated many small raiding parties into Ursh tasked when identifying weak points and enemy leaders. When 
                    the order was given, the 19th struck with efficiency and precision, striking down the Urshan warlords and leaving their armies leaderless and hence easily 
                    coerced into surrender. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the Great Crusade began, the 19th Legion served alongside the Luna Wolves, who were quickly reunited with their Primarch, Horus Lupercal. The two Legions 
                    complimented each other well - when the sudden attack of the Luna Wolves came, the 19th were already in position, having marked targets and cutting off lines 
                    of retreat and supply, leading the swift defeat of the foe. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion continued to recruit from Terra, their culture not deviating significantly from that of the Xeric. They kept their armour grey, but were wont to 
                    apply dust from the Dustfields to their armour, giving rise to names such as the <em>Pale Nomads</em> and the <em>Dust Clad</em>. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Primarch of the 19th Legion crash-landed on the moon of Lycaeus, orbiting the human colony of Kiavahr. Lycaeus was a prison-moon, the home of Kiavahr's 
                    political prisoners. Indeed, the infant Primarch was found and adopted by a team of miners interned on Lycaeus. They named him Corvus Corax, their word for 
                    <em>saviour</em> and <em>deliverer</em>, likely a bastardisation of the belief in many Terran cultures that the raven 
                    was a herald of fate and a messenger of death.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Though already possessing much technical and scientific knowledge, Corax was tutored by the prisoners of Lyceaus, who imparted the notions that had seen them 
                    locked up on Lycaeus - the ideas of justice and human dignity. They also taught patience, for Corax had to bide his time before he could launch a rebellion. 
                    It was here that Corax displayed a frankly remarkable ability - the ability to quite simply will any observers into disregarding his presence. Corax led small 
                    teams of prisoners of missions of sabotage and supply, gathering weapons and equipment for the coming rebellion and hamstringing the guards to paralyse their 
                    responses. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Soon after Corax launched his rebellion and liberted Lycaeus, the Emperor arrived alone to meet Corax. They spoke for a time, with the 
                    Emperor departing the next day, leaving Corax to finish his rebellion. Corax knew what he had to do, turning to the atomic mining charges stockpiled on Lycaeus. 
                    The bombardment was brief and targeted, the lords of Kiavahr soon surrendering.

                <p>
                    When Corax was reunited with his Legion, he was quick to institute sweeping changes. The speed, ruthlessness and vigilance of the old Legion was melded with 
                    the Primarch's stealth, guile and cunning. Corax also strove to reform the Legion's culture, as he saw the Legion's record in oppression and occupation 
                    campaigns mirroring the repressive policies of the lords of Kiavahr. Notably, several senior officers were reassigned, including Legion Master Arkhas Fal.

                <p>
                    The Legion's darkest hour was to come during the Battle of Gate 42. This battle was part of a wider campaign launched by the newly-made Warmaster Horus Lupercal to 
                    smother a rebellion in the Akum-Sothos Cluster, a rebellion that was later found to have been instigated by an alien parasite called the Unsighted Kings. 
                    Near the end of the campaign, Horus ordered Corax and his Legion to launch a frontal assault on Gate 42 to tie down its defenders and open the way for the Sons of 
                    Horus to end the rule of the Unsighted Kings. 
                    Corax, angered at his Legion being assigned to act as cannon fodder, assigned his Terran companies to the assault. The ensuing battle was bloody, and was only carried
                    when Corax entered the fray directly, firing his warriors to great feats of arms. Thousands of Raven Guard had been slain.

                <h4>Observations</h4>

                <p>
                    The Raven Guard adhere closely to the organisational pattern of the <em>Principia Bellicosa</em>. The Legion is divided into Chapters, which are divided into Companies. 
                    These Companies are the primary opertional unit. From a command standpoint, the Legion is not tightly controlled, and command authority is often devolved to the 
                    lowest levels, enabling individual Raven Guard units to take the initiative and make tactical decisions as needed. This is a direct inheritance of both the Xeric tribes, who 
                    relied on unconventional warfare to succeed against numerically superior foes, and Corax's own teachings that he learned on Lycaeus.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Doctrinally, the Legion prefers stealth and infiltration. That said, the Legion is still a modern Space Marine force and as such includes the full range of 
                    tanks, super-heavies, artillery and assault vehicles available to the Imperium. The Raven Guard employ these with customary skill, often using them in rapid-strike 
                    missions and to outflank the enemy.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    To aid their preferred style of war, the Legion deploys proportionally more reconnaissance units than other Legions, and each legionary is trained to conduct his 
                    usual role and also to act in the reconnaissance role. The Raven Guard also make extensive use of Moritats, those officers traditionally assigned to Destroyer units. 
                    These Moritats are often tasked with assassination and sabotage operations. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As with all Legions, the Raven Guard make use of Terminator armour, though their doctrine does not mesh well with the slow, bulky armour. Nonetheless, some units, mostly 
                    those who served closely with the Luna Wolves, have taken to using them. These units are not employed in the line breakers, as most Legions do, 
                    but instead are used to conduct close-range shock assaults and to support daring attacks by conventional Legion forces that flounder. Thus, they have become known as the 
                    Deliverers.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    Perhaps more than any other Primarch, Corax himself is known for taking the field directly and participating in combat operations. He often operates alone, or with small 
                    bands of the elite Shadowmasters, usually to either conduct deep recon prior to a battle, or to position himself to strike the final blow. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Numerically speaking, the Raven Guard are the smallest extant Space Marine Legion, mustering just less than 81,000 men. Not counted in this figure are 
                    a number of roving <em>nomad-predation</em> fleets, who operate on the fringes of the Imperium, performing long-range recon and dealing with threats 
                    before they can reach the Imperium's borders. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is well-equipped, as it is served by the forges of Kiavahr, which is now a Mechanicum domain. Amongst its armouries are Shadowhawks, which 
                    are Thunderhawks modified to be almost invisible to mechanical detection. The Legion also uses the Whispercutter, a small flyer with a gravitic motor that 
                    is capable of dropping ten legionaries in perfect silence. The Legion is also the first Legion to make widespread use of the newest iteration of Space Marine 
                    power armour, the Mk6 Corvus pattern, which boasts increased agility, an improved sensor suite and a distinctive beaked helm. 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    The gene-seed of the Raven Guard is known to give its recipients an unearthly appearance, turning their skin a pale white 
                    and their eyes and hair the darkest black. In situations of extreme stress, legionaries have been known to fight without regard for self-preservation, 
                    their sole aim to die taking as many of the foe with them as possible in a kind of silent berserker fury. 
                    In the culture of the Legion, these are known as the <em>Ash Blind</em> and the 
                    <em>Sable Brand</em>, since the eyes of the legionary turn completely black. Those warriors who survive the triggering situation can recover, but many more 
                    are plagued by a suicidal drive in combat. These are formed into units of Shadow Killers, who see use as shock troops. Many of the Legion's Moritats are 
                    drawn from the Sable Brand.
