            <h1>The Loyalist Legions</h1>

            <p>Those Legions who remained loyal to the Emperor of Mankind, the Nine Who Stood, were were able to prevail against their traitorous kin 
                through tenacity and skill at arms. They were unique military organisations, each with their own combat doctrines, rich histories and specialised units, which
                combined to see them win the Horus Heresy. See below for a deatiled breakdown of these famous, hard-fighting organisations

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>As their numerical designation suggests, the First Legion were the first of the Space Marine Legions to be founded. Given the secrecy surrounding the 
                    Space Marine project, little is known of the First Legion's founding. What is known is that they were intended to act as a template for 
                    further Legions, and as such, no attempt was made to foster specific military or culture traits, not curb any eccentricities. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The First Legion's founding was started approximately a century before the end of the Unification Wars. Given the untested nature of the Space Marines, 
                    a great many test subjects were used to create a relatively small number of Space Marines. These recruits were acquired from diverse sources. Terra had suffered 
                    greatly in the Age of Strife, and so suitable test subjects - untainted male youths - were in short supply. Hence, recruits were acquired from 
                    slave traders, conquered territories and allied subjects. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a result, the First Legion's recruits did not bear any cultural or genetic traits that carried over from their origins. They were a blank slate, so to speak.
                    Hence, the sons of Francish and Albian infantrymen mixed with the heirs of Skandic berserkers, Anatolic cavalry and dozens of other martial cultures. 
                    In effect, the First Legion was a melting pot for all of the bloody-handed martial lore acquired by the nations of Terra during the vicious wars of
                    Old Night. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To further cement this, the first legionaries chose to discard their old names, and adopt the names of ancient military heroes. Hence, men 
                    called Tarchon, Gilgamesh, Heracles, Hengist and many others could be found, these names being drawn from Mankind's bloody history. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    These first warriors, not yet numerous enough to fight as a single force, were deployed alongside the disparate armies of the Emperor. As only Space 
                    Marines can, they fought with a singular unity and potency, which saw them called the Uncrowned Princes, or Crowns for short. This was an homage 
                    to the Emperor, who was essential Mankind's monarch. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over time, the Legion developed Hosts. The Hosts were not organisational sub-units, but rather informal bodies of warriors who adapted the doctrines of 
                    the military cultures they had been recruited from for use by the Legion. These Hosts were able to advise their commanders, and when
                    this was unsufficient, even took over command when situations called their particular skills. The Hosts were invaluable in allowing the Legion
                    to fight as a multi-role combined arms force. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Hosts were not defined or fixed - their numbers rose and fell over time. As other Legions were activated, they used the doctrines and tactics 
                    developed by one Host or another, making those Hosts obsolete. Some Hosts were destroyed as their doctrines proved inadequate. Over time, the Legion 
                    became a well-honed, highly adaptable army, its disparate warriors bound together by the Hosts. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The First Legion would go on to decisively prove their worth in battle in their first large-scale engagement in 668.M30. At Samerkend, 10,000 men from 
                    the First Legion joined with a few hundred from 4 other Legions, and assembled to face down the Udug Hul, a 200,000 strong army of gene-forged soldiers
                    led by the King of Akkad. Up until then, the Akkadians had proved resistant to the Emperor's armies. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The result was a total slaughter - within 10 hours, the Udug Hul had been taken apart. One of the Legion's senior officers, Hector Thrane, was made 
                    Grandmaster. Thrane was given the task of taking on the most horrific foes and eradicating them. To accomplish this, the Legion was given the run of 
                    Imperial Palace's armouries, which held all of the most terrible weapons recovered from Terra. The disappearance of the Thunder Warriors at Mount Ararat
                    is an event shrouded in secrecy, though it is hinted that the First Legion supported the Legio Custodes in this task. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the Imperium geared up to begin the Great Crusade, the First Legion was sent out to fully secure the Solar system - they were assigned to the Oort Cloud, 
                    at the very edge of the system. There, they recovered the last few lost human outposts, and kept watch for xenos incursions. At this time, with the Hosts 
                    mature, the Legion developed the Orders, who were small organisations dedicated to a single focus of war. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To begin the Great Crusade, the First Legion was issued with its fleet. These were the system's relic-ships, those advanced vessels developed by Mankind during 
                    the Age of Technology that had survived the Age of Strife. All of the Legions received some of these ships - the <em>Gloriana-</em>class battleships 
                    used as Legion flagships were some of these ships. However, the First Legion recieved the lion's share of these ships, enough to equip an entire fleet.
                    This was a necessity, as the Legion's mission was to eradicate the xenos races that opposed the Great Crusade's first steps. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    These eradication missions became the bread-and-butter of the Legion's participation in the Crusade, a stark contast to the other Legion's tasking 
                    to Compliance actions. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    By this point, the Hosts of the Legion had mostly solidified. These were :
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Host of Crowns were the oldest Host, and specialised in shock assaults, line breaking and vanguard operations, a hold-over from the Legion's 
                            earliest actions supporting Imperial Army formations
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Blades were the largest Host, and specialised in line infantry tactics - close-order formation, gun lines and mass assault. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Pentacles had experimented with battle-psykers. Failing as often as they were wildly successful, the Host was considered unreliable
                            and soon disbanded. However, their contribution was not small - when the Librarius departments were founded, they were done so in part using 
                            traditions developed by the Host of Pentacles  
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Iron were the Legion's armoured warfare experts. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Fire were the Legion's spies, assassins, interrogators and reconnaissance troops. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Bone were the Legion's berserkers - savage reavers who sought to terrify the foe. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Stone were the Legion's siege warfare and fortification experts.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Wind were the Legion's skirmishers and cavalrymen, who excelled in fast-moving warfare. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of the Void were the last Host to be formed, and specialised in void war, boarding actions and teleport assaults.
                        </li>
                    
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The First Legion became a fearsome weapon - they boasted large numbers of legionaries, many capable ships and a large armoury. 
                    However, this soon led to arrogance - their many victories made them complacent, and they were more than happy to put their few defeats down to 
                    inferior officers. Unchallenged, the Hosts stopped innovating new doctrines, assuming there was nothing more to learn. Tradition and ritual began to 
                    dominate. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, the Legion was facing the end of their primacy. The other Legions were becoming established formations with their own specialisms and 
                    doctrines. Several had been reunited with their Primarchs, and were expanding rapidly. These other Legions were forging impressive combat records 
                    with long rolls of victories. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    At Canis-Balor, the Legion suffered a major reversal. Four attacks did little more than inflict terrible casualties, including Grandmaster Thrane. 
                    The masters of the Hosts and Orders started to blame each other for the failure, sure that their own doctrines were sound. This stalled their attempts 
                    to elect a new Grandmaster, as none of the masters could support any of the others. The deadlock was only broken when Malcador the Sigillite intervened and 
                    sponsored a candidate - the lowly Captain Vendraig, an unaligned line officer with a worthy tally of victories. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vendraig's first task was to restore unity. He was soon presented with an excellent opportunity for this - the Imperium had encountered a terrifying 
                    new foe - the Rangda. In 839.M30, at Advex-mors, the Rangda had gathered a large fleet and built a gigantic war-moon. The First Legion gathered, and within 
                    4 months they had broken the Rangda, losing 5,000 men in the process. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, this victory failed to galvanise the Legion. Word soon arrived of another difficult mission. The world-fortress of Karkasarn had resisted Guilliman's 
                    Ultramarines. Grandmaster Vendraig led 10,000 men to Karkasarn, landed and launched a savage frontal assault. Suffering terrible casualties, the Legion 
                    was able to batter its way in. As the Legion was about to win, the masters of Karkasarn detonated an atomic weapon, killing Vendraig and his detachment. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The masters of the Hosts upped the pace of deployments, entering wars and ending them quickly though often at great cost, always seeking to reclaim their glory. 
                    It was no use, for the other Legions continued to rack up their own victories. 
                    This frenzy would likely have ground the Legion down in time, were it not for the discovery of Caliban and with it, their Primarch, Lion el'Jonson.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Little is known of Jonson's childhood. His first proper human contact was with a band of knights led by his future adoptive father, Luther. 
                    Luther assumed Jonson to be about 10 years old, but Primarchs are known to develop differently to normal humans. Indeed, there are legends that 
                    a man-sized forest spirit had been seen in the forests near isolated villages for nearly a century. Given that Jonson was recovered some 150 years after 
                    Primarchs had been scattered, there may be some merit to this. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Soon after his recovery, the Jonson became a knight. The people of Caliban were being slowly hunted to extinction by the great beasts of the forests.
                    The knights were only able to slow this down. However, Jonson proved to be an excellent strategist, technologist and warrior, and soon he was able to 
                    lead the Calibanites in pushing back the beasts. Soon after the last beast fell, the Emperor arrived to spirit away Jonson. 
                    Caliban was made the new home-world of the Legion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Lion, as Jonson came to be known, decided to reunite his far-flung Legion. He set out with 20,000 men, coming to each task force in turn. When he 
                    joined each force, he led them into battle, testing their mettle, and then had them swear brief oaths of allegiance. Within a few years, the Legion had been 
                    unified, and was some 100,000 men strong. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Lion's first campaign was a return to Karkasarn, where the subjuagted population had risen up against the Ultramarines garrison, beseiging them within the 
                    fortress. The Lion led 1,000 men to relieve the garrison and then set another 10,000 men to work purging the remainder. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Soon after, the Rangda returned in 862.M30. This proved to be a much larger incursion than the Legion's first encounter. The Lion proved instrumental, 
                    leading near 300,000 legionaries from 9 Legions against the Rangda for 10 years. The First Legion incurred massive casualties, and when the dust settled, they 
                    could muster no more than a tenth of their original numbers.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's next campaign was to Sarosh, who had joined the Imperium willingly at first, but then baulked and rebelled at the Imperium's demands. 
                    They attempted to assassinate the Lion, but failed. However, the Lion learned of some dissension in his ranks, and at the dissatisfaction of Luther. 
                    Luther and his men were reassigned to Caliban as its garrison. 
                </p>
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The organisation of the Dark Angels is very complex. The first and most visible layer of organisation is the conventional military one, with Chapters, 
                    companies and squads. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The next layer is that of the Wings, which are carryovers from the Hosts. The Wings act as mini-Legions, each specialising in some broad aspect of 
                    warfare. Each legionary is holds a position in a wing, and interestingly a legionary's conventional rank is not related to his rank within his Wing. 
                    A legionary might be a lowly sergeant conventionally, but could hold a higher rank in his Wing. 
                    Within each Wing, each warrior may speak openly and discuss the business of the Wing, which helps the Wing continuously innovate and pursue excellence. 
                    The Wings are essentially carryovers from the Hosts, though there are only 6, and they are formed into the Hexagrammaton. These are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Stormwing are the largest Wing, and like the Host of Blades are composed of the Legion's line infantry. The specialise in complex 
                            manoeuvre under fire, keeping the Legion moving even under the most trying conditions. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Deathwing are the special operations force of the Legion, and specialise in line-breaker assaults. They also provide bodyguards to the 
                            Legion's officers. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Ravenwing are the skirmishers and scouts of the Legion, and also specialise in drop-pod assaults. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Dreadwing are the annihilation troops of the Legion, called upon when a foe needs to be eradicated. The Dreadwing are the home of 
                            the Destroyers and Moritats of the Legion, as well as many Techmarines. Dreadwing officers who have overseen the destruction of a world or race
                            are granted the title of Eskaton.  
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Ironwing are the armoured warfare specialists of the Legion, and also the siege warfare specialists, as they field many 
                            artillery pieces. Breachers, Terminators and Devastators are well-represented in the Legion. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Firewing are the assassins and champions of the Legion, and their role is to decapitate enemy formations by targeting commanders and officers. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Orders of the Legion are far more numerous and specialised. There are hundreds, and their specialisations are in narrow fields such as 
                    arctic warfare, anti-aircraft work and duelling. The Orders are called upon when Legion forces encounter a situation suited their skill-sets. 
                    When that happens, the Order in question calls its members and forms a cenobium, a specialised task force, to unleash whatever knowledge, experience or 
                    unique weaponry makes their Order special. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Orders are far more secretive that the Wings, and possess a hierarchy known only to their members. Membership involves secret rituals and ciphers. 
                    Only about half of the Legion can claim membership of an Order, as they are considerably more selective than the Wings. Their highly specialised fields 
                    require legionaries possessed of particular temperments and skillsets. A rare few legionaries can claim membership of more than one Order. One of these 
                    is the famed Knight Captain Atreus, who is a member of three Orders dedicated to swordsmanship, and his fighting style is a blend of the styles 
                    used by each, making him a deadly single combatant.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    One Order of particular note is the 500 Companions. These are the 500 men who first met Jonson on Caliban, and they have taken to protecting him in battle. 
                    Unlike other Primarchs, the 500 Companions were never formally named or formed by the Lion, but he silently acknowledges them by patiently waiting for them 
                    to assemble when he takes the field. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite possessing three command structures, the Dark Angels do not suffer from command confusion or paralysis. The three structures work in harmony to give
                    the Legion considerable flexibility and the ability to respond to changing battlefield conditions on the fly. Indeed, the three command structures give the 
                    Legion a deep pool of experience and commanders, so the Legion is rarely taken off guard by a enemy or deprived of direction when a commander falls. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Wings and Orders function in battle by commanders ceding command authority to the body that is most suited to the situation. For example, if enemy aircraft 
                    threaten the Legion, then the Order of Broken Wings will take over, and if an armoured attack is necessary, then the Ironwing will lead the way. 
                    The Dark Angels placed a great deal of trust in these formations, and as they are noted specialists, this flowing authority is effectively instinctual - 
                    it doesn't have to be called in any way. This system has proven extraordinarily effective, and allows the Legion to avoid falling back on 
                    gringing attrition - where an approach fails or stalls, the Legion simply shifts tactics to keep the battle flowing. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The deep pool of experienced officers allows the Legion to support many simultaneous deployments, each of which can operate independently. The Lion prefers
                    to engage in combat personally, though this doesn't hinder the Legion on the strategic plane, and their forces are more than capable 
                    of operating without oversight. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, the layered organisation is often confusing to outsiders and even brother Legions, whose lines of 
                    authority are often much simpler. That said, the Legion is known to use even this confusion to their advantage. Frequently, Legion groups will not 
                    present a single commander when meeting allied forces. Allied commanders will be watched and judged for who they choose to greet as a commander. Those who 
                    choose well, or are savvy enough to reserve judgement are given a measure of trust, whilst those who choose poorly are marked for scutiny and further lapses 
                    of judgement. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is not just the command arrangements of the Legion that make it effective. It is well-supplied in terms of personal weapons, vehicles and ships. 
                    This gives the Legion a significant edge. It can also field darker weapons normally forbidden to Imperial forces, such as gene-phages, exterminatus-grade 
                    munitions and nanites. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's holdings are minimal, restricted to Caliban and the industrial world of Gramarye, which is the meeting place of the Council of Masters. 
                    Several Orders maintain small bases and orbital installations, and these are used as resupply points.

                <h4>History</h4>

                <p>
                    The first men of the Fifth Legion were recruited from the nomadic tribes of the Thulean Basin. Their mission was to act as the Emperor's pathfinders
                    and scouts. They were to find the hidden bases and holdfasts of the Emperor's enemies. The early 5th Legion were often widely dispersed, their men often 
                    operating in squad-sized units. In these scouting operations, the legionaries were tested in ways rarely experienced by the early Space Marines. 
                    Rather than enduring extended combat operations and injuries, the 5th Legion had to contend with areas poisoned by radiological weapons, plagues and the 
                    aftermaths of war. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    These operations formed the early combat doctrines of the Legion. Their limited numbers made massed attacks impractical, and their typical isolated deployments
                    precluded any sort of spear-head role. Instead, the Legion fought as skirmishers, striking at weak points and fading away, their goal to have their enemies 
                    distracted and weakened when the main forces of the Emperor arrived. Using the Thulean nomads as recruiting stock was an excellent decision - they had 
                    long possessed a reputation for stoicism, independence and cunning. They were hardened survivors, and yet also capable with technology. These traits carried 
                    over into the Legion, making them wilful and independent, and the only commanders who could control them were the Emperor and those who had 
                    previously earned their respect. Nonetheless, the Legion was regularly praised for its fortitude and intelligence. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the Great Crusade was launched, the 5th Legion was not formed into a a handful of heavy-hitting task forces like the other Legions, but was rather 
                    split into some 100 groups called Pioneer Companies. Each of these Companies was a mini-Legion, capable of extended independent operation. Each was set to 
                    follow Warp currents to seek out lost human colonies and xenos strongholds. One Company, that of Kornelius Dure, discovered Cthonia, the future 
                    recruiting world of the Luna Wolvs. Dure saw the nest of savagery that Cthonia was turned into, and recommended its destruction. Horus, when he 
                    found out about this, was amused, and often had Dure's Company act as his scouts. More largely, Horus often praised the Pioneer Companies for their 
                    service, and the Terran members of the Legion respected him for it.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion, widely spreadout across the stars, solidified its overarching combat doctrine of hit-and-run warfare. However, despite this, the Legion was often 
                    far from supply bases, and so was being slowly ground down. This continued for some 50 years, until Jaghatai Khan, their Primarch was unexpectedly returned 
                    to them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jaghatai had crash-landed on Chogoris, a minerally-rich world with a stable, untainted population, a stark contrast to many Primarchs, who had often landed on
                    inhospitable worlds. Jaghatai was, like many Primarchs, adopted by a human father, in this case a Khan, or leader, of a tribe. A rival tribe, called the Kurayed, 
                    attacked Jaghatai's tribe and slew his Khan. Normally, the Chogorian tribes would relatiate by conducting a raid of their own. Instead, Jaghatai gathered his tribe
                    and made total war upon the Kurayed, who were destroyed in a single night. Jaghatai, now Khan, pursued a campaign of unification, destroying or subjugating other 
                    tribes. Some others surrended and joined willingly. Jaghatai took measured to end the relentless feuding between the tribes, merging and splitting them. 
                    After a time, Jaghatai was made Khagan, or Khan of Khans.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another power dominated Chogoris, a settled empire, where Jaghatai's coaltion ruled the mountainous areas and the steppes. The son of the Palatine, the 
                    leader of the empire, was slain during an attempt to ambush Jaghatai. In response, the Palatine invaded Jaghatai's domain, and he countered by resorting 
                    to the tribes' well-practised hit-and-run tactics. Jaghatai attacked the empire, subjugating entire cities until he ruled all of Chogoris. A short while 
                    later, the Emperor arrived to reclaim Jaghatai. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jaghatai faced a difficult task in unifying his Legion. The Pioneer Companies had expanded to number some 800, and the Legion itself 
                    numbered perhaps 80,000, achieved through opportunistic recruitment. Widely spread out, with some acting as scouts for other Legions, each of the 
                    Companies had developed their own traditions, rituals and doctrines. Those operating alongside brother Legions had come to adopt some 
                    aspects of their culture. The Khan recalled his Companies, and recruited the first batch of men from Chogoris. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    It took nearly a decade from 865.M30 to recall the better part of the Legion, and some would rejoin to meet Jaghatai until the start of M31, some 135 years 
                    after the command had been issued. The majority, though, were called down to the Empty Quarter, the tribal area of Chogoris. Through Chogorian rituals, the 
                    Pioneer Companies were unified into the White Scars, a name acquired from Jaghatai's requirement that each warrior scar his face and adopt a new Chogorian name.
                </p>

                    The White Scars were encouraged to study the Noble Pursuits of the Chogorian people - storytelling, hunting and calligraphy. These were to be the Truth of the Legion, 
                    their overarching culture. To bind the now unified Legion together more fully, the Khan led them into a campaign to subjuage the Kolarne Circle. Many casualties would be 
                    suffered, but through the campaign, the Khan taught his Legion that only as one Legion could they prevail against Mankind's enemies.
                </p>

                <h4>Observations</h4>

                <p>
                    The White Scars prefer a very mobile style of warfare. Despite their savage, tribal appearance, the White Scars are capable strategists, and are intelligent 
                    and insightful. That said, they do not conduct excessive planning or preparation, which often places them at odds with more inflexible Legions. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The White Scars are not traditionally disciplined, but are not wild. They value results over doctrine, and trust that their performance will vindicate
                    them when they clash with others. Culturally, they value courtsey and honesty over protocol. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Khan is an insular figure who finds friendship with few of his brothers. Of these few, the Khan favours Magnus for his honesty, integrity and pursuit of 
                    knowledge. Notably, Magnus and the Khan collaborated on the formation of the Librarius departments. He also favous Horus for his focus on results over 
                    doctrine. The Khan is a skilled combatant and strategist, and has a keen eye for the flow of battle. He embodies the doctrine of his Legion, placing himself 
                    in positions where he is both least expected and most effective.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion has never adhered closely to the organisation laid down in the <em>Principia Bellicosa</em>, and this remains true under the Khan. 
                    The Legion is composed of a number of Hordes, the rough equivalent of Chapters in other Legions, insofar as they are the highest level sub-unit. 
                    The number of Hordes varies - sometimes Hordes will combine, other times they will split. Hordes are commanded by Noyan-Khans, the most senior
                    warleaders of the Legion, and number between 5,000 and 20,000. Their frequent shifting of sizes and composition often causes logistics and assignment 
                    issues. It is rare for Hordes to muster their entire strength in one location, and even rarer for two or more Hordes to cooperate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below the Hordes are the Brotherhoods, the rough equivalent of Companies. These are commanded by Khans, whose preferences, reputation and charisma influence
                    how many men they can muster. Most Khans prefer the Legion's customary mobile style of warfare, equipping their Brotherhoods with either a large number of biker
                    units for skirmishing, or loading infantry in transports for fast dismount assaults. That said, some Khans use a siege, heavy weapon or artillery doctrine, 
                    equipping their Brotherhoods accordingly. These units are not disdained by the majority, and are in fact often honoured for sacrificing speed for the 
                    decisive firepower needed for victory in some tasks. Whatever their composition, most Brotherhoods include a Keshig, formation that acts as something 
                    between a bodyguard for their Khan, and an elite reserve. The Brotherhoods are the primary strategic unit of the Legion, and will commonly conduct 
                    operations by themselves.            
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion places great value on its Librarius department, and individual Librarians are called Stormseers, or <em>zadyin arga</em> in Chogorian. 
                    The Stormseers are well respected, and are often found advising their Khans. Rather than using the more overt psychic powers preferred by most 
                    Librarians, Stormseers support their brothers by impeding the foe with fog, rain, hail or monsoons. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whilst the Legion does field Destroyer units, they are not favoured, as their weapons often ruin the natural beauty of many worlds. White Scars Destroyers 
                    are known as <em>karaoghlanar</em> or the Dark Sons of Death. This formation is attached directly to the Stormseer council, and parcelled out to warzones 
                    only when deemed necessary. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion lacks both an elite formation and a disciplinary corps, though the <em>kharash</em> serve as both. Men may elect to join the <em>kharash</em>
                    to either expunge some stain on their honour or to gain fame and advancement. From this, the <em>kharash</em> typically undertake the most dangerous missions
                    such as diversionary attacks and shock assaults. They are also the primary users of Terminator plate, which suits their dangerous taskings. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's recon troops and head-hunters are called the <em>burgediin sarhvu</em>, or Falcon's Claws. The <em>uhaan solban</em> are the Legion's 
                    Dreadnoughts. Given the Legion's preference for fast moving warfare, the Dreadnoughts are rarely seen outside of Chogoris and Terra, where they guard the 
                    Legion's gene-seed repositories. The <em>akoghlanar</em> are the Legion's Apothecaries, who serve on an individual basis across the Brotherhoods. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion maintains its own titles for specialist officers. A Brotherhood's Khan will often designate a Kav-khan as his second officer. The Legion's 
                    ships are captained by Tenri-khan, and the Legion's Techmarines and Forge Lords are called Gan-khan. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The White Scars can currently muster around 95,000 men. 
                </p>

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The first men of the 6th Legion were recruited from some of the most violent and regressive groups to survive the Unification Wars, and recruits were 
                    chosen on an individual basis. Hence, much like the First Legion, the 6th Legion had no overall cultural imprint. Unlike other Legions, they did not see 
                    service in the Unification Wars. As a result, they did not acquire particular recruiting areas or any rewards, such as the extensive genetics laboratories
                    of Luna. Perversely, this may have saved them from the crisis that wiped out the 3rd Legion's gene-seed reserves and damaged the reserves of the 5th and 9th
                    Legions.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the Great Crusade got underway, the Legion was not openly deployed, and no one can say what happened in those years. This period of seeming 
                    inactivity ended after about a decade, when they were deployed to Delsvaan, a human colony. The Legion, then 3,500 strong, conducted a fast spear-tip style
                    operation. Their attack was savage and free-flowing - they reaved anything in their path and bypassed any target too well-defended to easily overcome. So bloody 
                    was their attack that it is suspected that Enoch Rathvin, their Legion Master, may even have lost control over his men. As a result of the Delsvaan action, 
                    the 6th Legion was granted their own Expedition Fleet.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's recruitment rate was low, and so they tended to support other Legions or Imperial Army force by conducting hunter-killer missions and urban combat. 
                    When leading Imperial Army forces, the Legion had a tendency to act as discipline masters, and for meting out summary discipline.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion of this period was noted for having a fractured hierarchy. Officers relied on their battlefield reputation, charisma and personal combat skill to 
                    maintain their position and enforce their orders. Battlefield executions were not unheard of.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion earnt a nickname from their battlefield doctrine - The Rout. This came from a perceived keenness to chase down fleeing foes, much like the predatory
                    carrion hounds of Terra who tormented bands of refugees. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Primarch of the 6th Legion, Leman Russ, crash-landed on the winter world of Fenris, and Russ' name was actually rendered as Leman of the Russ, the Russ being
                    the tribe that took him in. Russ' exploits are unknown, but unlike many Primarchs, he did not pursue a campaign of planetary unification, and when he was recovered
                    by the Emperor, Fenris remained a harsh, wild place with tribes constantly warring. When Russ joined his Legion, several hundred of his companions joined him as 
                    Astartes. As they were fully grown men, undertaking the implantation process would be an insane risk with a very high failure rate. Amazingly, many of 
                    Russ' companions survived, speaking to the incredible resilience of the Fenrisian people. Russ was also able to use his own pure genetic 
                    material to stabilise the implantation process, which solved the unusually high implantation failure rate that the Legion had been suffering from, leading 
                    to their low numbers. Russ' companions were known as the Varagyr, or Wolf Guard. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Russ' first campaign was the purgation of the Ork worlds of the Wheel of Fire. Russ capitalised on his Legion's strengths, undertaking a relentless series 
                    of shock assaults from multiple directions. Casualties were heavy - some 7,500 men, including Enoch Rathvin, leaving 15,000. After the campaign was complete, 
                    the Legion returned to Fenris, on which the Mechanicum had been busily constructing the Fang. The Fang was to serve as the Legion's base of operations, and was
                    outfitted with armouries and gene-forges. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Russ' first take was to expand the Legion. They recruited heavily from Fenris, and rumours abounded of the Legion bolstering Fenris' population with captives from 
                    feral worlds. To aid recruitment, Russ instructed his priests to spread tales through the oral story-tellers and skjalds of the Fenris. Through these, the Fang was 
                    made into the domain of the Fenrisian gods, and aspiring warriors were to travel there to serve as warriors for the Allfather. 
                </p>
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The 6th Legion's gene-line is given to producing fractious personalities. To counter this, Russ has instituted a savage martial culture that gives 
                    imparts discipline and control to his warriors. The outward appearance of this culture makes the Wolves appear savage and tribal - their armour is 
                    often bedecked with furs, leather and bone charms.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's overall combat doctrine is one of close quarters shock assault, and the bulk of the Legion are fast moving shock troopers. The Wolves are 
                    single-minded in battle - they will clinically target weak-points and bypass strongpoints. Heavier support from tanks and Devastators is concentrated into 
                    specialised detachments. This frees the Legion's line troops to move quickly. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion is composed of 13 Great Companies, the equivalent of Chapters. Each Great Company is notionally 10,000 men strong, but battle attrition means 
                    that they are often understrength. There is no defined organisation below the Great Company. The Legion's officers, called Jarls and Thegns, 
                    control their own warbands within Great Companies, and their strengths fluctate with attrition and the leader's reputation. Warriors and squads may move 
                    freely between the warbands of officers. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The First Great Company is Russ' own, and is staffed with his own Huscarls and the Legion's Terminator elite. The 7th Great Company controls the Legion's 
                    specialised formations. These include the Legion's Destroyers, called the <em>landayvan</em>, "those who lay the land waste". The Legion's siege and artillery
                    formations are under the control of the 7th Great Company. The last unit within the 7th is the Black Cull, a cult that worships Morkai. The Black Cull are the 
                    true berserkers of the Legion, and are used as the tip of the spear in suicidal line-breaker assaults. 
                </p>
