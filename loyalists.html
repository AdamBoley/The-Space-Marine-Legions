            <h1>The Loyalist Legions</h1>

            <p>Those Legions who remained loyal to the Emperor of Mankind, the Nine Who Stood, were were able to prevail against their traitorous kin 
                through tenacity and skill at arms. They were unique military organisations, each with their own combat doctrines, rich histories and specialised units, which
                combined to see them win the Horus Heresy. See below for a deatiled breakdown of these famous, hard-fighting organisations

                <h4>History</h4>
    
                <p>As their numerical designation suggests, the First Legion were the first of the Space Marine Legions to be founded. Given the secrecy surrounding the 
                    Space Marine project, little is known of the First Legion's founding. What is known is that they were intended to act as a template for 
                    further Legions, and as such, no attempt was made to foster specific military or culture traits, not curb any eccentricities. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The First Legion's founding was started approximately a century before the end of the Unification Wars. Given the untested nature of the Space Marines, 
                    a great many test subjects were used to create a relatively small number of Space Marines. These recruits were acquired from diverse sources. Terra had suffered 
                    greatly in the Age of Strife, and so suitable test subjects - untainted male youths - were in short supply. Hence, recruits were acquired from 
                    slave traders, conquered territories and allied subjects. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a result, the First Legion's recruits did not bear any cultural or genetic traits that carried over from their origins. They were a blank slate, so to speak.
                    Hence, the sons of Francish and Albian infantrymen mixed with the heirs of Skandic berserkers, Anatolic cavalry and dozens of other martial cultures. 
                    In effect, the First Legion was a melting pot for all of the bloody-handed martial lore acquired by the nations of Terra during the vicious wars of
                    Old Night. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To further cement this, the first legionaries chose to discard their old names, and adopt the names of ancient military heroes. Hence, men 
                    called Tarchon, Gilgamesh, Heracles, Hengist and many others could be found, these names being drawn from Mankind's bloody history. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    These first warriors, not yet numerous enough to fight as a single force, were deployed alongside the disparate armies of the Emperor. As only Space 
                    Marines can, they fought with a singular unity and potency, which saw them called the Uncrowned Princes, or Crowns for short. This was an homage 
                    to the Emperor, who was essential Mankind's monarch. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over time, the Legion developed Hosts. The Hosts were not organisational sub-units, but rather informal bodies of warriors who adapted the doctrines of 
                    the military cultures they had been recruited from for use by the Legion. These Hosts were able to advise their commanders, and when
                    this was unsufficient, even took over command when situations called their particular skills. The Hosts were invaluable in allowing the Legion
                    to fight as a multi-role combined arms force. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Hosts were not defined or fixed - their numbers rose and fell over time. As other Legions were activated, they used the doctrines and tactics 
                    developed by one Host or another, making those Hosts obsolete. Some Hosts were destroyed as their doctrines proved inadequate. Over time, the Legion 
                    became a well-honed, highly adaptable army, its disparate warriors bound together by the Hosts. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The First Legion would go on to decisively prove their worth in battle in their first large-scale engagement in 668.M30. At Samerkend, 10,000 men from 
                    the First Legion joined with a few hundred from 4 other Legions, and assembled to face down the Udug Hul, a 200,000 strong army of gene-forged soldiers
                    led by the King of Akkad. Up until then, the Akkadians had proved resistant to the Emperor's armies. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The result was a total slaughter - within 10 hours, the Udug Hul had been taken apart. One of the Legion's senior officers, Hector Thrane, was made 
                    Grandmaster. Thrane was given the task of taking on the most horrific foes and eradicating them. To accomplish this, the Legion was given the run of 
                    Imperial Palace's armouries, which held all of the most terrible weapons recovered from Terra. The disappearance of the Thunder Warriors at Mount Ararat
                    is an event shrouded in secrecy, though it is hinted that the First Legion supported the Legio Custodes in this task. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the Imperium geared up to begin the Great Crusade, the First Legion was sent out to fully secure the Solar system - they were assigned to the Oort Cloud, 
                    at the very edge of the system. There, they recovered the last few lost human outposts, and kept watch for xenos incursions. At this time, with the Hosts 
                    mature, the Legion developed the Orders, who were small organisations dedicated to a single focus of war. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    To begin the Great Crusade, the First Legion was issued with its fleet. These were the system's relic-ships, those advanced vessels developed by Mankind during 
                    the Age of Technology that had survived the Age of Strife. All of the Legions received some of these ships - the <em>Gloriana-</em>class battleships 
                    used as Legion flagships were some of these ships. However, the First Legion recieved the lion's share of these ships, enough to equip an entire fleet.
                    This was a necessity, as the Legion's mission was to eradicate the xenos races that opposed the Great Crusade's first steps. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    These eradication missions became the bread-and-butter of the Legion's participation in the Crusade, a stark contast to the other Legion's tasking 
                    to Compliance actions. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    By this point, the Hosts of the Legion had mostly solidified. These were :
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Host of Crowns were the oldest Host, and specialised in shock assaults, line breaking and vanguard operations, a hold-over from the Legion's 
                            earliest actions supporting Imperial Army formations
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Blades were the largest Host, and specialised in line infantry tactics - close-order formation, gun lines and mass assault. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Pentacles had experimented with battle-psykers. Failing as often as they were wildly successful, the Host was considered unreliable
                            and soon disbanded. However, their contribution was not small - when the Librarius departments were founded, they were done so in part using 
                            traditions developed by the Host of Pentacles  
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Iron were the Legion's armoured warfare experts. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Fire were the Legion's spies, assassins, interrogators and reconnaissance troops. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Bone were the Legion's berserkers - savage reavers who sought to terrify the foe. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Stone were the Legion's siege warfare and fortification experts.
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of Wind were the Legion's skirmishers and cavalrymen, who excelled in fast-moving warfare. 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            The Host of the Void were the last Host to be formed, and specialised in void war, boarding actions and teleport assaults.
                        </li>
                    
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The First Legion became a fearsome weapon - they boasted large numbers of legionaries, many capable ships and a large armoury. 
                    However, this soon led to arrogance - their many victories made them complacent, and they were more than happy to put their few defeats down to 
                    inferior officers. Unchallenged, the Hosts stopped innovating new doctrines, assuming there was nothing more to learn. Tradition and ritual began to 
                    dominate. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Furthermore, the Legion was facing the end of their primacy. The other Legions were becoming established formations with their own specialisms and 
                    doctrines. Several had been reunited with their Primarchs, and were expanding rapidly. These other Legions were forging impressive combat records 
                    with long rolls of victories. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    At Canis-Balor, the Legion suffered a major reversal. Four attacks did little more than inflict terrible casualties, including Grandmaster Thrane. 
                    The masters of the Hosts and Orders started to blame each other for the failure, sure that their own doctrines were sound. This stalled their attempts 
                    to elect a new Grandmaster, as none of the masters could support any of the others. The deadlock was only broken when Malcador the Sigillite intervened and 
                    sponsored a candidate - the lowly Captain Vendraig, an unaligned line officer with a worthy tally of victories. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Vendraig's first task was to restore unity. He was soon presented with an excellent opportunity for this - the Imperium had encountered a terrifying 
                    new foe - the Rangda. In 839.M30, at Advex-mors, the Rangda had gathered a large fleet and built a gigantic war-moon. The First Legion gathered, and within 
                    4 months they had broken the Rangda, losing 5,000 men in the process. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, this victory failed to galvanise the Legion. Word soon arrived of another difficult mission. The world-fortress of Karkasarn had resisted Guilliman's 
                    Ultramarines. Grandmaster Vendraig led 10,000 men to Karkasarn, landed and launched a savage frontal assault. Suffering terrible casualties, the Legion 
                    was able to batter its way in. As the Legion was about to win, the masters of Karkasarn detonated an atomic weapon, killing Vendraig and his detachment. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The masters of the Hosts upped the pace of deployments, entering wars and ending them quickly though often at great cost, always seeking to reclaim their glory. 
                    It was no use, for the other Legions continued to rack up their own victories. 
                    This frenzy would likely have ground the Legion down in time, were it not for the discovery of Caliban and with it, their Primarch, Lion el'Jonson.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Little is known of Jonson's childhood. His first proper human contact was with a band of knights led by his future adoptive father, Luther. 
                    Luther assumed Jonson to be about 10 years old, but Primarchs are known to develop differently to normal humans. Indeed, there are legends that 
                    a man-sized forest spirit had been seen in the forests near isolated villages for nearly a century. Given that Jonson was recovered some 150 years after 
                    Primarchs had been scattered, there may be some merit to this. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Soon after his recovery, the Jonson became a knight. The people of Caliban were being slowly hunted to extinction by the great beasts of the forests.
                    The knights were only able to slow this down. However, Jonson proved to be an excellent strategist, technologist and warrior, and soon he was able to 
                    lead the Calibanites in pushing back the beasts. Soon after the last beast fell, the Emperor arrived to spirit away Jonson. 
                    Caliban was made the new home-world of the Legion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Lion, as Jonson came to be known, decided to reunite his far-flung Legion. He set out with 20,000 men, coming to each task force in turn. When he 
                    joined each force, he led them into battle, testing their mettle, and then had them swear brief oaths of allegiance. Within a few years, the Legion had been 
                    unified, and was some 100,000 men strong. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Lion's first campaign was a return to Karkasarn, where the subjuagted population had risen up against the Ultramarines garrison, beseiging them within the 
                    fortress. The Lion led 1,000 men to relieve the garrison and then set another 10,000 men to work purging the remainder. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Soon after, the Rangda returned in 862.M30. This proved to be a much larger incursion than the Legion's first encounter. The Lion proved instrumental, 
                    leading near 300,000 legionaries from 9 Legions against the Rangda for 10 years. The First Legion incurred massive casualties, and when the dust settled, they 
                    could muster no more than a tenth of their original numbers.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's next campaign was to Sarosh, who had joined the Imperium willingly at first, but then baulked and rebelled at the Imperium's demands. 
                    They attempted to assassinate the Lion, but failed. However, the Lion learned of some dissension in his ranks, and at the dissatisfaction of Luther. 
                    Luther and his men were reassigned to Caliban as its garrison. 
                </p>
    
                <h4>Observations</h4>
    
                <p>
                    The organisation of the Dark Angels is very complex. The first and most visible layer of organisation is the conventional military one, with Chapters, 
                    companies and squads. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The next layer is that of the Wings, which are carryovers from the Hosts. The Wings act as mini-Legions, each specialising in some broad aspect of 
                    warfare. Each legionary is holds a position in a wing, and interestingly a legionary's conventional rank is not related to his rank within his Wing. 
                    A legionary might be a lowly sergeant conventionally, but could hold a higher rank in his Wing. 
                    Within each Wing, each warrior may speak openly and discuss the business of the Wing, which helps the Wing continuously innovate and pursue excellence. 
                    The Wings are essentially carryovers from the Hosts, though there are only 6, and they are formed into the Hexagrammaton. These are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Stormwing are the largest Wing, and like the Host of Blades are composed of the Legion's line infantry. The specialise in complex 
                            manoeuvre under fire, keeping the Legion moving even under the most trying conditions. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Deathwing are the special operations force of the Legion, and specialise in line-breaker assaults. They also provide bodyguards to the 
                            Legion's officers. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Ravenwing are the skirmishers and scouts of the Legion, and also specialise in drop-pod assaults. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Dreadwing are the annihilation troops of the Legion, called upon when a foe needs to be eradicated. The Dreadwing are the home of 
                            the Destroyers and Moritats of the Legion, as well as many Techmarines. Dreadwing officers who have overseen the destruction of a world or race
                            are granted the title of Eskaton.  
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Ironwing are the armoured warfare specialists of the Legion, and also the siege warfare specialists, as they field many 
                            artillery pieces. Breachers, Terminators and Devastators are well-represented in the Legion. 
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The Firewing are the assassins and champions of the Legion, and their role is to decapitate enemy formations by targeting commanders and officers. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Orders of the Legion are far more numerous and specialised. There are hundreds, and their specialisations are in narrow fields such as 
                    arctic warfare, anti-aircraft work and duelling. The Orders are called upon when Legion forces encounter a situation suited their skill-sets. 
                    When that happens, the Order in question calls its members and forms a cenobium, a specialised task force, to unleash whatever knowledge, experience or 
                    unique weaponry makes their Order special. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Orders are far more secretive that the Wings, and possess a hierarchy known only to their members. Membership involves secret rituals and ciphers. 
                    Only about half of the Legion can claim membership of an Order, as they are considerably more selective than the Wings. Their highly specialised fields 
                    require legionaries possessed of particular temperments and skillsets. A rare few legionaries can claim membership of more than one Order. One of these 
                    is the famed Knight Captain Atreus, who is a member of three Orders dedicated to swordsmanship, and his fighting style is a blend of the styles 
                    used by each, making him a deadly single combatant.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    One Order of particular note is the 500 Companions. These are the 500 men who first met Jonson on Caliban, and they have taken to protecting him in battle. 
                    Unlike other Primarchs, the 500 Companions were never formally named or formed by the Lion, but he silently acknowledges them by patiently waiting for them 
                    to assemble when he takes the field. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite possessing three command structures, the Dark Angels do not suffer from command confusion or paralysis. The three structures work in harmony to give
                    the Legion considerable flexibility and the ability to respond to changing battlefield conditions on the fly. Indeed, the three command structures give the 
                    Legion a deep pool of experience and commanders, so the Legion is rarely taken off guard by a enemy or deprived of direction when a commander falls. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Wings and Orders function in battle by commanders ceding command authority to the body that is most suited to the situation. For example, if enemy aircraft 
                    threaten the Legion, then the Order of Broken Wings will take over, and if an armoured attack is necessary, then the Ironwing will lead the way. 
                    The Dark Angels placed a great deal of trust in these formations, and as they are noted specialists, this flowing authority is effectively instinctual - 
                    it doesn't have to be called in any way. This system has proven extraordinarily effective, and allows the Legion to avoid falling back on 
                    gringing attrition - where an approach fails or stalls, the Legion simply shifts tactics to keep the battle flowing. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The deep pool of experienced officers allows the Legion to support many simultaneous deployments, each of which can operate independently. The Lion prefers
                    to engage in combat personally, though this doesn't hinder the Legion on the strategic plane, and their forces are more than capable 
                    of operating without oversight. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, the layered organisation is often confusing to outsiders and even brother Legions, whose lines of 
                    authority are often much simpler. That said, the Legion is known to use even this confusion to their advantage. Frequently, Legion groups will not 
                    present a single commander when meeting allied forces. Allied commanders will be watched and judged for who they choose to greet as a commander. Those who 
                    choose well, or are savvy enough to reserve judgement are given a measure of trust, whilst those who choose poorly are marked for scutiny and further lapses 
                    of judgement. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is not just the command arrangements of the Legion that make it effective. It is well-supplied in terms of personal weapons, vehicles and ships. 
                    This gives the Legion a significant edge. It can also field darker weapons normally forbidden to Imperial forces, such as gene-phages, exterminatus-grade 
                    munitions and nanites. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Legion's holdings are minimal, restricted to Caliban and the industrial world of Gramarye, which is the meeting place of the Council of Masters. 
                    Several Orders maintain small bases and orbital installations, and these are used as resupply points.
